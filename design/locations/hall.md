## Descriptions

The hall is the very first room the player sees. It is directly shown after the intro.

After that, the hall is usually just a walk-through room.

There's the [front_door](../items/front_door.md) and the [hall_sideboard](../items/hall_sideboard.md) here. Wooden Stairs are leading up to the [upper_hall](upper_hall.md). Clicking on the front of the image leads to the [living_room](living_room.md)

A [hall_lamp](../items/hall_lamp.md) lights the room in night scenes, it can be turned on and off via [hall_lightswitch](../items/hall_lightswitch.md).

The floor is made out of wood tiles.

We need a night, a day variant and a variant with the lamp turned off in both.
