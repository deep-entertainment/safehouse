## Description

The court room is a backdrop for the epilogue scene between [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) and [brianna](../characters/brianna.md). It symbolizes safety. It should not only make [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) feel safe, but the player as well. It is grand and old and emits nobility. Pretty much styled like the courthouse meeting rooms in "Law & Order"

There are bookshelves filling the walls.

It's a meeting room in the courthouse. The walls are made of oak wood, there's a dark brown carpet on the floor.
