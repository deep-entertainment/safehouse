# Comment

In this dialog, the main topic is the death of Jacob Grimes. Marjorie has searched online about it, but hasn't got any details. She wants to know the official version.

Brianna can't give her all the details because of legal matters. However, Marjorie succeeds on getting at least _some_ details.

It is pointed out, that:

* Jacob was a lowlife gang banger, accused of stealing, doing graffiti
* Jacob saw Igino Varone killing of Derek Cole, an opposing drug dealer
* Jacob spent four days in the house until he was found hung in his bedroom (which is Marjorie's room now)
* The bedroom was locked
* Calvin was on that job
* Everybody assumed the pressure drove Jacob to suicide, but it wasn't apparent before the event
