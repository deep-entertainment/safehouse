This dialog runs after Marjorie had found the fake diary of Jacob Grimes. She wants to ask Rebeca (Calvin is not around at this time) about this. Rebeca doesn't give out much. Only that the diary is about one "Jacob Grimes" and that he was found dead eighteen years ago.

However, during the course of the dialog, Marjorie reveals the diary to Rebeca. She is interested, takes it and reads in it afterwards. She then cuts off the dialog.
