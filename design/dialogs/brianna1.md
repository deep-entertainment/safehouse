> Marjorie, I'm Brianna Alison. I'm the district attorney and will lead the case against Igino Varone.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Yes, I know who you are. Calvin told me that you'll come.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> I see. (beat) (friendly) So. Have you settled in?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Well... yes. I guess. It's... It is like it is.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Yes, I understand. It's not easy.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> No, it isn't.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> But you manage?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> I... (reassuring herself) Yes, I got this.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Great. Thank you so much for your support.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> I hope it helps.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Oh, it definitely does. So, if it's okay with you, can we go back to last Friday please?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Yes, okay.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> I know it's hard, Marjorie. But can you please tell me what happened?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Again?

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Yes. I have to prepare you for the time during the trial. You will have to repeat it there as well and be prepared for questions from the defense attorney.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) 
>
> (sighs)

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Yes, I know. I try to protect you at all times, but there will be questions the judge will allow and that you have to answer. Do you understand?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Yes. I guess.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Okay, so what happened on Friday?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Well, I was out of milk and went to the Shop-O down the street.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> What time was it?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> 7-7:30 pm

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Seven or seven thirty? Can you pinpoint the incident more exactly? The time frame might prove to be important.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> It was seven thirty. I watched a comedy show I regularly watch and it had just finished, so I was on the street at seven thirty pm. Five minutes to the Shop-O.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Good. Continue.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> I walked into the shop and said hi to... To Jazir.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Jazir Bijarani? The man who owned the shop?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) 
> 
> (sad) Yes. Jazir.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Okay, please continue.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> I went to the fridge to get some milk when I heard an argue over at the counter.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> You're doing great, Marjorie.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> There... I saw Jazir with the guy they arrested.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Do you know his name?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Varone.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Please say his full name.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) 
> 
> (sighs) Igino Varone. He was shouting at Jazir. He was furious. I guess, he didn't know I was around.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> What were they arguing about?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> I don't know. This Varone guy kept shouting: "You think you can fuck with me? You really think you can fuck with me". Those kind of words.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> And Jazir?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> He was terrified. I mean, we all know who Igino Varone is. You don't want him shouting at you.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> What do you mean that you all know who he is?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> He's "La Famiglia". He's doing all sorts of stuff. Killing people, selling drugs, prostitution...

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Marjorie, we don't have any proof of *those* kind of things.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) 
> 
> (angry) But everybody *knows* he does that!

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> (calming her down) Maybe, but we have to concentrate on this specific case for which we have *your* word and a few dozen clues. Okay?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Okay.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Great. Thank you. So Mr. Bijarani was terrified.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Yes. And he said, that he didn't know what Varone was talking about. And then... (still shocked from the events)
> 
> All of the sudden... he drew a gun and... pointed at him, I quickly hid behind a shelf.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> How far was this shelf away from the counter?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> I don't know. It was the second row in the back where the fridges were. I guess... I guess maybe 30 feet or something.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Okay, go on.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> So I hid and Varone kept on shouting and then... (pauses)

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Should we take a break?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> No, it's... It's fine. Thank you.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Okay.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Then he shot. BAM BAM BAM. Three times. (sobbing) He shot Jazir three times. There was blood everywhere.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> What did you do then?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) 
> 
> (still sobbing) I was in shock. I still hid behind the shelf. I didn't (sob) scream, I... why didn't I scream? I lost track of time. Then I looked to the counter again, but Varone was gone. I went to (sob) I went to Jazir and... all this blood. (she cries)

Some seconds pass and we just hear Marjorie crying and sobbing. Then:

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Can you continue?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) (still sobbing, but getting herself together)
> 
> Yes... yes, okay. (breath) Jazir wasn't breathing anymore, so I took the phone and called 911.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> And then?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> What do you mean?

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> You have to tell things exactly and completely as they were. If you leave things out, the defense will rip you open on those.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Okay I... I freaked. It was all too much, you know?

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Yes, I understand. What did you do?

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> I just ran. I ran home and locked my doors. I expected to get shot every second. I only opened when the police knocked as they were questioning the neighborhood.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Okay. I think, they will ask you why you didn't stay and help Jazi

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) 
> 
> (interrupts shouting) HE WAS FUCKING DEAD!

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> (Trying to calm her down) Yes, I know. I can understand that. Please calm down.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md) 
> 
> (still shouting) I SAW HIM DIE!

Brianna is quiet.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
>
> FUCK! 
>
> (pauses) 
>
> They will ask something like that?

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> Look, you're the witness. That makes you the defense's enemy. If they can't prove, that you're lying, they have to render you unreliable.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Okay.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> The best thing is to stay calm and I know how hard that is. Stay calm and answer their questions truthfully.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Okay. I'll try.

> [brianna](../characters/brianna.md)
> 
> I know. Thank you so much for helping us!

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> Okay.
