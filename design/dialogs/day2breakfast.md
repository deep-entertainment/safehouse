# varonearrest

> CALVIN
> 
> Not me.

> REBECA
> 
> I was there. I was in the squad.

> MARJORIE
> 
> That sounds exciting!

> REBECA
> 
> Eh, pretty standard job, I'd say. It's not like raiding a drug house. Everything's nice and clean and you're greeted by their lawyer the minute you knock on the door.

> MARJORIE
> 
> He wasn't afraid or anything?

> REBECA (hard laugh)
> 
> Varone? That guy? That guy isn't afraid of anything. Not with all the lawyers, his (making fun of the name) "La Famiglia" suckers and bribed cops.

> CALVIN
> 
> You don't know that.

> REBECA
> 
> Pff.

> 
> Yeah, only six people know about your whereabouts. And three of them are sitting at this table.

> CALVIN
> 
> Right.
