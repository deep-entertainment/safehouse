# Day 2 Breakfast

#dialogs #livingroom 

# Comment

This dialog is used to introduce the atmosphere and tensions between the three main characters. We start characterizing them as follows:

* Marjorie: shy, nervous, tense. She also has a bad conscience about what happened with the phone before. She tries to overcome all this by being talkative
* Calvin: calm, helpful, nice, understandable. This is all a front, but it has to be believable to the player at that point
* Rebeca: mean, tense, angry

We also push up the tension between Marjorie and Rebeca more.

# varonearrest

> [calvin](../characters/calvin.md)
> 
> Not me.

> [rebeca](../characters/rebeca.md)
> 
> I was there. I was in the squad.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> That sounds exciting!

> [rebeca](../characters/rebeca.md)
> 
> Eh, pretty standard job, I'd say. It's not like raiding a drug house. Everything's nice and clean and you're greeted by their lawyer the minute you knock on the door.

> [marjorie](../characters/marjorie.md)
> 
> He wasn't afraid or anything?

> [rebeca](../characters/rebeca.md)
> 
> (hard laugh) Varone? That guy? That guy isn't afraid of anything. Not with all the lawyers, his (making fun of the name) "La Famiglia" suckers and bribed cops.

> [calvin](../characters/calvin.md)
> 
> You don't know that.

> [rebeca](../characters/rebeca.md)
> 
> Pff.

> 
> Yeah, only six people know about your whereabouts. And three of them are sitting at this table.
