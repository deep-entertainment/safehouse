In this brianna dialog, Marjorie asks Brianna about Rebeca, because she's her main suspect for trying to scare her to cancel her testimony. Marjorie starts with general questions about Rebeca and then trying more and more to get into possible wrongdoings by Rebeca which is the point at which Brianna asks her if something's wrong and Marjorie backs off and they continue their usual preparations for the testimony.

Things to establish here:

* Rebeca's backstory as a police enthusiast, a very sucessful graduate of the police academy
* Rebeca is overly correct and has a high claim for justice
* Rebeca has had some complaints about not acting appropriately in some cases because she can be quite hot-headed (which Marjorie jumps on), but all were minor issues
