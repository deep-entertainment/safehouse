## Abstract

A mob murder witness is taken into a safe house by the police for five days before her testimony. She's protected by two police officers. One of them is on the mob murder's payroll and already staged a suicide for a witness eighteen years ago. He first tries to scare her with the old story by leaving scary notes and scaring her. On the last day, his masquerade is dropped and he first kills the other officer and tries to kill the witness, but she can knock him down and escape.

## Characters

### Marjorie Tailor, the main character

Marjorie is a black woman, aged 34. At the beginning of the game, she is calm and shy and insecure. Through the events in the game, she becomes confident and strong.

Throughout the game, she is scared (her fears growing with the events)

* Age: 34

* Gender: cis female

* Height: 165 cm

* Weight: 120 kg

* Eyes: brown

* Hair: Short, brown

* Skin tone: brown

* Clothes: 
  
  * Blue short dress
  
  * Pink shoes

### Calvin Andrews, a police officer

Calvin is one of the two detectives that ought to protect Marjorie in the safe house. However, he's actually also on Varone's payroll and staged the suicide of Jacob Grimes eighteen years ago. He tries to scare and eventually kill Marjorie (which is only revealed on the last day)

Superficially, he's a nice and caring man in his 50s. Father-figure type. And this is the (visual) progression that he goes through: Starting as nice and trustworthy and becoming mean and ruthless.

* Age: 57

* Gender: cis male

* Height: 180cm

* Weight: 90kg

* Eyes: green

* Hair: sparse, black/gray

* Skin tone: gray

* Clothes:

  * Black shoes

### Rebeca Pliego, a police officer

Rebeca is one of the two police officers that ought to protect Marjorie in the safe house.

She's young, rough and harsh and she's not really happy spending five days "babysitting" Marjorie like she puts it. Throughout the events (especially on the fourth and fifth day) she becomes helping and warm.

Because she finds about about Calvin's motives, she is killed by him on the fifth day.

* Age: 28

* Gender: cis female

* Height: 170 cm

* Weight: 65 kg

* Eyes: green

* Hair: long (pony tail), brown

* Skin tone: light brown

* Clothes:
  
  * black suit (looking "correct"), no tie
  
  * black shoes

### Brianna Allison, district attorney

Brianna is the district attorney in the case where Marjorie is the key witness. She's a tough dog in the courtroom, but caring and cautious when she speaks with Marjorie.

She visits the house each day to prepare Marjorie for her testimony and on the fifth day, she rescues Marjorie after she knocked out Calvin.

She doesn't have much character progression. Her character is used to tell the back story of the murder through her talks with Marjorie and as the last safe resort and trust in the juridical system in the last scene.

## Scenes

### INTRODUCTION - BLACK SCREEN

*Cutscene starts*

*SFX: Composition, see further description*

Over the black starting credits, we hear a car driving over the pebbels of a driveway. The engine is turned off, we hear three people exiting the car. Doors slam, the trunk is opened. They walk up the pathway, we hear keys jingling, slided into a door. The door is unlocked, the people walk through and slam the door.

Fade in: "Day 1", Fade out.

### HALL - MORNING

MARJORIE, CALVIN and REBECA stand in front of the front door. We see a bagpack, a bag and a suitcase in front of them. The bagpack belongs to CALVIN, the bag to REBECA and the suitcase to MARJORIE.

They stand there for a few seconds, looking around. MARJORIE is frightened, she is taking in the uncommon surroundings. REBECA is annoyed, she is filling out a form. 

*AMBIENT: Filling out a form*

CALVIN calmly looks around.

> MARJORIE
> 
> So... this is it?

> CALVIN

(beat) *AMBIENT: (stop)*

> REBECA (harsh)
> 
> Living room is right this way, kitchen to the left, the bathroom and the bedrooms are upstairs. Your room is just across the stairs. Can't miss it.

REBECA takes her bag and walks off to the living room.

*SFX: Walking on wooden floor*

(beat)

CALVIN looks at Marjorie, nods friendly. MARJORIE tries a smile. CALVIN takes his bagpack and walks off to the living room.

*SFX: Walking on wooden floor*

MARJORIE grabs her suitcase.

### MARJORIE'S ROOM - MORNING

MARJORIE enters the room, looks around, then puts her suitcase on the bed, opens it.

*SFX: Suitcase on bed, opening suitcase*

*Cutscene ends*

#### PUZZLE 1.1: Unpack

Click on the suitcase.

> MARJORIE
> 
> Well. Time to unpack I guess.

Click (unpack) the items in the suitcase. Those items are presented:

* Shirts (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

* Sweaters (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

* Today's newspaper (Featuring a big article about the trial of Igino *and* various other articles) (SFX: Unfolding paper)

  > TODO

* Pants (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

When Marjorie unpacks the pants, her phone falls out and smashes on the floor into four pieces: (*SFX: Object crashing on floor*)

* Phone

* Battery

* Casing

* SIM-Card

They slide in all directions.

> MARJORIE
> 
> TODO

#### PUZZLE 1.2: Assembling the phone

Find the four items by examining the things in the bedroom:

* Bed
  Finding the phone underneath it:
  
  > MARJORIE
  > 
  > Oh, there's the phone.

* Wardrobe (finding the SIM-Card in front of it)
  
  > MARJORIE
  > 
  > There's that tiny phone card.

* Nightstand (finding the casing)
  
  > MARJORIE
  > 
  > Here's the casing

* Stool (finding the battery)
  
  > MARJORIE
  > 
  > Ah, there's the battery.

> MARJORIE
> 
> I think that's all.

Combine the items in the correct order with the phone:

* SIM (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

* Battery (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

* Casing (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

> MARJORIE
> 
> There. It works again.
>

#### PUZZLE 1.3: Finding the PIN

Click the suitcase again and unpack further. Following items are unpacked:

* Toiletries bag (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

* Underwear (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

* Bras (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

* Purse (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

> MARJORIE

Open the purse. Closeup of the purse contains:

* Picture of Marjories mother
  
  > MARJORIE
  > 
  > My mom

* Small amount of money
  
  > MARJORIE
  > 
  > I never carry around much cash, I use the credit card usually.

* Credit card
  
  > MARJORIE
  > 
  > My card

* A note
  
  > MARJORIE
  > 
  > Oh, that's my secret note. Yeah, I know you shouldn't write your passwords down, but my brain's a sieve. I wrote down
  > 
  > 4872
  > 
  > RUBE
  > 
  > caTerp1llar

*SFX: Dialtones, when buttons on phone are pressed*

Using 4872 as the phone pin yields:

> MARJORIE
> 
> No, that's my credit card pin. I can remember that, because I use it more often.

Using RUBE(=7823) as the phone pin solves the puzzle

### MARJORIE'S ROOM - MORNING

MARJORIE dials (*SFX: Dialtones*). After some moments, we hear:

> MARJORIE (very emotional)

We hear REBECA from the outside:

> REBECA
> 
> Marjorie, I have some shee--

REBECA has entered the door MARJORIE'S room and sees her on the phone.

> REBECA (shouting)
> 
> YOU IDIOT!

She rushes to MARJORIE, grabs the phone, slams it on the ground (which breaks it again) and then stomps her feet on the phone. MARJORIE starts to cry.

> REBECA (shouting)
> 
> WHAT PART OF WITNESS PROTECTION DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND, DUMBASS?

She walks up and down the room.

> REBECA
> 
> NOT only that I WASTE MY TIME AND FUCKING RISK MY LIFE babysitting her, she goes about and brings a FUCKING PHONE TO HER SAFE HOUSE.

She turns around, pointing at MARJORIE

> REBECA (getting really mean)
> 
> DO YOU WANT HIM TO KILL YOU RIGHT AWAY? WE COULD ALL SAVE SOME TIME IF YOU'D SAY.

> REBECA
