## Abstract

A mob murder witness is taken into a safe house by the police for five days before her testimony. She's protected by two police officers. One of them is on the mob murder's payroll and already staged a suicide for a witness twenty years ago. He first tries to scare her with the old story by leaving scary notes and scaring her. On the last day, his masquerade is dropped and he first kills the other officer and tries to kill the witness, but she can knock him down and escape.

## Characters

### Marjorie Tailor, the main character

Marjorie is a black woman, aged 34. At the beginning of the game, she is calm and shy and insecure. Through the events in the game, she becomes confident and strong.

Throughout the game, she is scared (her fears growing with the events)

* Age: 34

* Gender: cis female

* Height: 165 cm

* Weight: 120 kg

* Skin tone: brown

* Clothes: 
  
  * Blue short dress
  
  * Pink shoes

### Calvin Andrews, a police officer

Calvin is one of the two detectives that ought to protect Marjorie in the safe house. However, he's actually also on Varone's payroll and staged the suicide of Jacob Grimes twenty years ago. He tries to scare and eventually kill Marjorie (which is only revealed on the last day)

Superficially, he's a nice and caring man in his 50s. Father-figure type. And this is the (visual) progression that he goes through: Starting as nice and trustworthy and becoming mean and ruthless.

* Age: 57

* Gender: cis male

* Height: 180cm

* Weight: 90kg

* Eyes: green

* Hair: sparse, black/gray

* Skin tone: gray

* Clothes:

  * Black shoes

### Rebeca Pliego, a police officer

Rebeca is one of the two police officers that ought to protect Marjorie in the safe house.

She's young, rough and harsh and she's not really happy spending five days "babysitting" Marjorie like she puts it. Throughout the events (especially on the fourth and fifth day) she becomes helping and warm.

Because she finds about about Calvin's motives, she is killed by him on the fifth day.

* Age: 28

* Gender: cis female

* Height: 170 cm

* Eyes: green

* Hair: long (pony tail), brown

* Skin tone: light brown

* Clothes:
  
  * black suit (looking "correct"), no tie
  
  * black shoes

She visits the house each day to prepare Marjorie for her testimony and on the fifth day, she rescues Marjorie after she knocked out Calvin.

She doesn't have much character progression. Her character is used to tell the back story of the murder through her talks with Marjorie and as the last safe resort and trust in the juridical system in the last scene.
