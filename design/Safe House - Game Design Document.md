## Abstract

A mob murder witness is taken into a safe house by the police for five days before her testimony. She's protected by two police officers. One of them is on the mob murder's payroll and already staged a suicide for a witness eighteen years ago. He first tries to scare her with the old story by leaving scary notes and scaring her. On the fourth day, his masquerade is dropped and he first tries to kill the other officer, but the witness interrupts him, then he tries to kill her, but she can hold him back and is saved in the last minute by the other officer.

## Characters

### Marjorie Tailor, the main character

Marjorie is a black woman, aged 34. At the beginning of the game, she is calm and shy and insecure. Through the events in the game, she becomes confident and strong.

Because Rebeca is very rough to her, she begins to suspect, that she tries to scare her, but ultimatively, it's Calvin that tries to attack her and this gets settled in the very last scene.

Throughout the game, she is scared (her fears growing with the events)

* Height: 165 cm

* Weight: 120 kg

* Eyes: brown

* Skin tone: brown

### Calvin Andrews, a police officer

Calvin is one of the two detectives that ought to protect Marjorie in the safe house. However, he's actually also on Varone's payroll and staged the suicide of Jacob Grimes eighteen years ago. He tries to scare and eventually kill Marjorie (which is only revealed on the last day)

Superficially, he's a nice and caring man in his 50s. Father-figure type. And this is the (visual) progression that he goes through: Starting as nice and trustworthy and becoming mean and ruthless.

* Gender: cis male

* Height: 180cm

* Weight: 90kg

* Eyes: green

* Hair: sparse, black/gray

* Skin tone: gray

  * Black shoes

### Rebeca Pliego, a police officer

Rebeca is one of the two police officers that ought to protect Marjorie in the safe house.

She's young, rough and harsh and she's not really happy spending five days "babysitting" Marjorie like she puts it. After the event with the noose she gets suspcious of Calvin and investigates behind his back which leads to a standoff of them two on day four.

Because she finds about about Calvin's motives, she is killed by him on the fifth day.

She visits the house each day to prepare Marjorie for her testimony and on the fifth day, she rescues Marjorie after she knocked out Calvin.

She doesn't have much character progression. Her character is used to tell the back story of the murder through her talks with Marjorie and as the last safe resort and trust in the juridical system in the last scene.

### Day 1

#### Morning

Marjorie, Calvin and Rebeca arrive at the safe house in New Jersey. They make themselves at home. Marjorie goes upstairs in her bedroom to unpack. She had smuggled a phone into the safe house and calls her mother, gets interrupted by Rebeca, who screams at her, grabs her phone and storms off.

#### Noon

They talk over the dinner about what happened. Calvin tries to comfort Marjorie, Rebeca is still pouty of her.

#### Afternoon

Brianna visits and reveals the Igino backstory.

#### Evening

Marjorie goes up to her room to find a noose hanging from the ceiling. She screams, runs away and into Calvin in the hall. Calvin calms her down, tells her to wait in the hall, goes into her room and quickly removes the noose (unknown to the player). At the same time, Rebeca arrived and rushes up behind Calvin.

Calvin and Rebeca came back and tell Marjorie, that there's no noose and she must've hallucinated. Calvin manages to calm her down, Rebeca is strangely quiet and absent minded.

### Day 2

#### Morning

Marjorie, Calvin and Rebeca eat breakfast. Calvin reads the New York Standard. In the dialog, Marjorie tries to gather more information about Igino and La Famiglia.

After finishing the breakfast, Marjorie goes into her room and finds a gruesome drawing with an eerie children's poem on her bed, which ultimatively leads to the combination of the padlock on the drawer in her room.

She opens the lock with it and finds the fake diary of Jacob Grimes. Downstairs, she finds Rebeca and talks to her. She reveals, that Jacob Grimes was found dead in Marjorie's room 18 years ago. (It is not yet revealed, that Jacob hang himself or that Calvin was assigned to that case)

As Rebeca doesn't tell her more, Marjorie wants to investigate. She needs her phone for that.

Rebeca sits on the couch, Marjorie's phone sticking out of one of her pockets. Marjorie needs to walk into the kitchen and look through the hatch to get it in the right moment.

But her SIM is gone, so she needs wifi. There actually is a wifi in the house used by the detectives, but it's locked.

Marjorie traces the signal to a loose board in the upstairs hall. She gets a knife from the kitchen and pries open the board to find the router. She turns the router around to finds a password. It isn't the right one, though. A paper in the junk in the kitchen shows how to decipher it.

She logs into the wifi and searches for "Jacob Grimes" to find that he had hung himself in her room 18 years ago and that Calvin was assigned to that case.

#### 11:00 am

Brianna visits and Marjorie asks her about Jacob's story.

#### 2:40 am (nightmare)

Marjorie wakes up from a sound, sits up in her bed and sees Igino in the doorway, aiming a gun at her. He shoots and she wakes up and quickly sits up, gasping. It's early morning in day 3.

### Day 3

#### Early morning

Marjorie sits in her bed. Her room is dark, only the dim light of the windows sheds some light into their side of the room.

Marjorie gets up to find the light switch, but the lamp can't be turned on because the bulb has blown. 

She finds the lamp, but it's too high for her. She finds a stepladder in one cupboard of the kitchen and uses it to get to the lamp.

She finds the lamp and unscrews the bulb, then goes into the lower hall where she finds a matching bulb, turns of the light to cool down the bulb, waits a few seconds in the darkness and then unscrews the bulb.

Upon screwing in the bulb into her lamp again, the light immediately flashes on and she sees, that there's a hook hidden in the shade of her lamp. There's something on the hook, but it's too tiny to see.

She finds a magnifying glass in a drawer in the kitchen.

She inspects the hook with the magnifying glass and finds hemp fibres. Slowly she realizes, that somebody tries to scare her and that the noose actually *was* there on the evening of day 1.

She wants to investigate, if somebody left fingerprints there. She suspects Rebeca.

#### Morning

Marjorie and Calvin sit and eat breakfast. Rebeca is at the now open cupboard in the living room. Calvin tells her to join them, to which she reluctantly agrees to. She leaves the cupboard open.

As they are eating, Marjorie tries to grill Rebeca to find out wether she tries to scare her. They get into an argue, Calvin gets in between and something he says triggers something in Rebeca, so she backs off and tells him that she will go shopping and leaves (the cupboard is still open)

After breakfast, Marjorie again takes the dishes to the kitchen. She wonders that the supplies seem to be fully stocked.

In the trash she finds a make-up brush.

She additionally gathers adhesive tape from a drawer in the hall, the fingerprint powder from the unlocked cupboard.

As she's back in her room after getting all the things, Brianna arrives and she is interrupted.

#### Afternoon

Brianna visits and Marjorie questions her about Rebeca.

#### Evening

In the meantime, Rebeca is back. Marjorie gets the fingerprints from the hook and tricks Rebeca into drinking from a glass that Marjorie snatches and gets her fingerprints off.

She compares the fingerprints and they match. She's now convinced, that Rebeca is trying to scare her.

### Day 4

#### Early morning

Marjorie wakes up to the sound of a fight. She walks down to find Calvin shooting Rebeca. Calvin turns around and goes at her. In fear, she turns around and runs into her room and pushes a cupboard in front of her door.

Calvin at first tries to sweet talk her, but ultimatively looses his nerves and screams at her. He shoots and pushes against the door. The cupboard moves and the door opens. Calvin comes in, but is gunned down by the wounded Rebeca, who breaks down.

Marjorie talks to her, gets a cloth and Rebecas mobile from the kitchen, gives the cloth to Rebeca to still the wound and calls 911.

### Day 5

#### Afternoon

Marjorie sits with Brianna. They talk about Calvin. In the end, Marjorie confirms to Brianna, that she will appear in court and make her testimony.

The end.

##### Newspaper

A typical New York newspaper called "New York Standard". There's a big article with a photo of Igino, and several articles around it.

The articles read:

**MOB BOSS ON TRIAL** by Tyrice Curtis

Igino Varone (shown left), the alleged head of "La Famiglia", the New York based crime organization, will be on trial this friday afternoon after having been accused of killing a shop owner in the lower east side.

District Attorney Brianna Allison tells the New York Standard that she will aim for a life sentence. "We have solid evidence", Misses Allison says, "We also have a witness, so I have no doubt that the jury will rule in our favor. It's time that we put an end to the business of La Famiglia!"

The trial will start on Friday, 4pm, court room 10.

**HOMELESS SHELTER GOES UP IN FLAMES** by Jasmine Guyot

East village - a building used as a homeless shelter burnt down to the ground yesterday evening. Officer Mike Greyson, who was the first at the crime scene, told the New York Standard that arson can not be ruled out at this point. Until the police has other leads, the remains of the shelter will be treated as a crime scene. It's recommended to stay clear of the area due to the probable instability of the building. The gruesome numbers are as of yet: 12 casualties, 34 people with burn injuries, that have been taken to Beth Israel Hospital.

**VISIT SWEDEN! A TRAVEL COMMENTARY** by Carol Reed

New York Standard's own Carol Reed is travelling Europe and reports all about the nicest destinations in the old world.

This time, Carol visits the town of Norrköping, just about 120 miles east of Stockholm, Sweden's capital. Read all about Sweden's wonderful countryside and art on page 14.

**POLICE NOTICES**

New York City police are investigating after a dumpster was found Monday night filled with dozens of pounds of cocaine. Police says the 60 pounds of cocaine was estimated to be worth $6.6 million.
A person, suspected of a crime related to the incident, is held in police custody awaiting a court hearing.
