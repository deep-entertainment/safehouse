## Ideas

These things still need to be either deleted or included into the scenes:

* Calvin tries to scare Marjorie on various occasions (without her knowing) with the death of Jacob. These scares need to get bigger with each time

* There's a locked drawer in Marjorie's room and on day two, Marjorie finds a key on her bed. Upon opening the drawer, she finds an old, scary make-up diary seemingly written by Jacob,  made up of two pages holding a paper clip. She takes the paper clip, remarking it could help her, when she gets her phone back.

* Marjorie steals her phone back from Rebeca to research something online. However, Rebeca removed the SIM card. 

* Because of this, Marjorie still has no internet connection because of the missing SIM card. Marjorie finds a wifi though but has to get the password for it. She traces the wifi signal back to a place somewhere she has to break open to find the router. On the back of the router, the password is noted

* On the first evening, Marjorie finds a hanging noose in her room. When she rushes out, she runs into the arms of Calvin, who tells her to stay out, goes into her room (secretly removes the noose he previously put there) and tells her, that nothing's there. He comforts her and tells her, that she is frightened and her mind plays tricks on her

* There's a cupboard with a compartment used by the cops in the living room which contains an old fingerprint kit with only the fingerprint powder left in it and a magnifying glass (among other items like vests, emergency information, etc.) The compartment is unlocked on day two and Marjorie takes out the magnifying glass. She comments on the powder, that she doesn't need it.

* On day two the lightbulb in her room goes off and she has to find a new one. There's one in the hall, but she has to turn it off and wait for a few moments until she can use it.

* Later, when she changes the lightbulb in her room, she finds a sturdy hook inside her lamp. She inspects it with a magnifying glass and finds fresh hemp fibers on it and gets suspicious

* On day three, the compartnent of the cupboard in the living room, is locked and Marjorie uses the pin to break it open. She takes the fingerprint powder.

* Because she's so mean to her, Marjorie suspects Rebeca to be the one who tries to scare her. She assembles a fingerdust kit from the following items:
  
  * Fingerprint powder
  
  * Adhesive tape (from a drawer in the kitchen)
  
  * Old makeup brush in a wastepaper basket

* She gets fingerprints by taking it from a glass she tricked Rebeca to drink from

* On day five, morning, she gets the fingerprints from the lamp and compares them with Rebeca's, but they don't match. Then the finale unwinds.

## Abstract

A mob murder witness is taken into a safe house by the police for five days before her testimony. She's protected by two police officers. One of them is on the mob murder's payroll and already staged a suicide for a witness eighteen years ago. He first tries to scare her with the old story by leaving scary notes and scaring her. On the last day, his masquerade is dropped and he first kills the other officer and tries to kill the witness, but she can knock him down and escape.

## Characters

### Marjorie Tailor, the main character

Marjorie is a black woman, aged 34. At the beginning of the game, she is calm and shy and insecure. Through the events in the game, she becomes confident and strong.

Throughout the game, she is scared (her fears growing with the events)

* Age: 34

* Gender: cis female

* Height: 165 cm

* Weight: 120 kg

* Eyes: brown

* Hair: Short, brown

* Skin tone: brown

* Clothes: 
  
  * Blue short dress
  
  * Pink shoes

### Calvin Andrews, a police officer

Calvin is one of the two detectives that ought to protect Marjorie in the safe house. However, he's actually also on Varone's payroll and staged the suicide of Jacob Grimes eighteen years ago. He tries to scare and eventually kill Marjorie (which is only revealed on the last day)

Superficially, he's a nice and caring man in his 50s. Father-figure type. And this is the (visual) progression that he goes through: Starting as nice and trustworthy and becoming mean and ruthless.

* Age: 57

* Gender: cis male

* Height: 180cm

* Weight: 90kg

* Eyes: green

* Hair: sparse, black/gray

* Skin tone: gray

* Clothes: 
  
  * Worn-out brown suit, light gray tie
  
  * Black shoes

### Rebeca Pliego, a police officer

Rebeca is one of the two police officers that ought to protect Marjorie in the safe house.

She's young, rough and harsh and she's not really happy spending five days "babysitting" Marjorie like she puts it. Throughout the events (especially on the fourth and fifth day) she becomes helping and warm.

Because she finds about about Calvin's motives, she is killed by him on the fifth day.

* Age: 28

* Gender: cis female

* Height: 170 cm

* Weight: 65 kg

* Eyes: green

* Hair: long (pony tail), brown

* Skin tone: light brown

* Clothes:
  
  * black suit (looking "correct"), no tie
  
  * black shoes

### Brianna Allison, district attorney

She visits the house each day to prepare Marjorie for her testimony and on the fifth day, she rescues Marjorie after she knocked out Calvin.

She doesn't have much character progression. Her character is used to tell the back story of the murder through her talks with Marjorie and as the last safe resort and trust in the juridical system in the last scene.

* Weight: 80 kg

#### PUZZLE 1.2: Assembling the phone

##### Newspaper

A typical New York newspaper called "New York Standard". There's a big article with a photo of Igino, and several articles around it.

The articles read:

**MOB BOSS ON TRIAL** by Tyrice Curtis

Igino Varone (shown left), the alleged head of "La Famiglia", the New York based crime organization, will be on trial this friday afternoon after having been accused of killing a shop owner in the lower east side.

District Attorney Brianna Allison tells the New York Standard that she will aim for a life sentence. "We have solid evidence", Misses Allison says, "We also have a witness, so I have no doubt that the jury will rule in our favor. It's time that we put an end to the business of La Famiglia!"

The public case will be held on friday, 4pm, court room 10. Limit seats available.

**HOMELESS SHELTER GOES UP IN FLAMES** by Jasmine Guyot

East village - a building used as a homeless shelter burned down to the ground yesterday evening. Officer Greyson, first to be at the crime scene, told the New York Standard, that an arson can not be ruled out at this time and until the police has other leads, the remains of the shelter are treated like a crime scene. It's recommended to stay clear of the area because of the probable instability of the building. The gruesome numbers: 12 people died, 34 people with burn injuries were taken to Beth Israel Hospital.

**VISIT SWEDEN! A TRAVEL COMMENTARY** by Carol Reed

New York Standard reporter Carol Reed is abroad in Europe and tells all about the nicest places in the old world.

This time, Carol visits the town of NorrkÃ¶ping, just about 120 miles east of Stockholm, Sweden's capital. Read all about Sweden's wonderful countryside and art on page 14.

**POLICE NOTICES**

New York City police are investigating after a dumpster was found Monday night filled with dozens of pounds of cocaine. Police says the 60 pounds of cocaine was estimated to be worth $6.6 million and that it had been sold in Los Angeles.
