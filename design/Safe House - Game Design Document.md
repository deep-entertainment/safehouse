## Abstract

A mob murder witness is taken into a safe house by the police for five days before her testimony. She's protected by two police officers. One of them is on the mob murder's payroll and already staged a suicide for a witness eighteen years ago. He first tries to scare her with the old story by leaving scary notes and scaring her. On the fourth day, his masquerade is dropped and he first tries to kill the other officer, but the witness interrupts him, then he tries to kill her, but she can hold him back and is saved in the last minute by the other officer.

## Characters

### *MARJORIE* Tailor, the main character

*MARJORIE* is a black woman, aged 34. At the beginning of the game, she is calm and shy and insecure. Through the events in the game, she becomes confident and strong.

Because *REBECA* is very rough to her, she begins to suspect, that she tries to scare her, but ultimatively, it's *CALVIN* that tries to attack her and this gets settled in the very last scene.

Throughout the game, she is scared (her fears growing with the events)

Superficially, he's a nice and caring man in his 50s. Father-figure type. And this is the (visual) progression that he goes through: Starting as nice and trustworthy and becoming mean and ruthless.

* Weight: 90kg

* Eyes: green

* Hair: sparse, black/gray

### *REBECA* Pliego, a police officer

*REBECA* is one of the two police officers that ought to protect *MARJORIE* in the safe house.

She's young, rough and harsh and she's not really happy spending five days "babysitting" *MARJORIE* like she puts it. After the event with the noose she gets suspcious of *CALVIN* and investigates behind his back which leads to a standoff of them two on day four.

Because she finds about about *CALVIN*'s motives, she is killed by him on the fifth day.

She visits the house each day to prepare *MARJORIE* for her testimony and on the fifth day, she rescues *MARJORIE* after she knocked out *CALVIN*.

She doesn't have much character progression. Her character is used to tell the back story of the murder through her talks with *MARJORIE* and as the last safe resort and trust in the juridical system in the last scene.

### Day 1

#### Morning

*MARJORIE*, *CALVIN* and *REBECA* arrive at the safe house in New Jersey. They make themselves at home. *MARJORIE* goes upstairs in her bedroom to unpack. She had smuggled a phone into the safe house and calls her mother, gets interrupted by *REBECA*, who screams at her, grabs her phone and storms off.

#### Noon

They talk over the dinner about what happened. *CALVIN* tries to comfort *MARJORIE*, *REBECA* is still pouty of her.

#### Afternoon

*BRIANNA* visits and reveals the *IGINO* backstory.

#### Evening

*MARJORIE* goes up to her room to find a noose hanging from the ceiling. She screams, runs away and into *CALVIN* in the hall. *CALVIN* calms her down, tells her to wait in the hall, goes into her room and quickly removes the noose (unknown to the player). At the same time, *REBECA* arrived and rushes up behind *CALVIN*.

*CALVIN* and *REBECA* came back and tell *MARJORIE*, that there's no noose and she must've hallucinated. *CALVIN* manages to calm her down, *REBECA* is strangely quiet and absent minded.

### Day 2

#### Morning

*MARJORIE*, *CALVIN* and *REBECA* eat breakfast. *CALVIN* reads the New York Standard. In the dialog, *MARJORIE* tries to gather more information about *IGINO* and La Famiglia.

After finishing the breakfast, *MARJORIE* goes into her room and finds a gruesome drawing with an eerie children's poem on her bed, which ultimatively leads to the combination of the padlock on the drawer in her room.

She opens the lock with it and finds the fake diary of *JACOB* Grimes. Downstairs, she finds *REBECA* and talks to her. She reveals, that *JACOB* Grimes was found dead 18 years ago. (It is not yet revealed, that *JACOB* hang himself or that *CALVIN* was assigned to that case)

As *REBECA* doesn't tell her more, *MARJORIE* wants to investigate. She needs her phone for that.

*REBECA* sits on the couch, *MARJORIE*'s phone sticking out of one of her pockets. *MARJORIE* needs to walk into the kitchen and look through the hatch to get it in the right moment.

But her SIM is gone, so she needs wifi. There actually is a wifi in the house used by the detectives, but it's locked.

*MARJORIE* traces the signal to a loose board in the upstairs hall. She gets a knife from the kitchen and pries open the board to find the router. She turns the router around to finds a password. It isn't the right one, though. A paper in the junk in the kitchen shows how to decipher it.

She logs into the wifi and searches for "*JACOB* Grimes" to find that he had hung himself in her room 18 years ago and that *CALVIN* was assigned to that case.

#### Afternoon

*BRIANNA* visits and *MARJORIE* asks her about *JACOB*'s story.

#### Night

*MARJORIE* wakes up from a sound, sits up in her bed and sees *IGINO* in the doorway, aiming a gun at her. He shoots and she wakes up and quickly sits up, gasping. It's early morning in day 3.

### Day 3

#### Early morning

*MARJORIE* sits in her bed. Her room is dark, only the dim light of the windows sheds some light into their side of the room.

*MARJORIE* gets up to find the light switch, but the lamp can't be turned on because the bulb has blown. 

She finds the lamp, but it's too high for her. She finds a stepladder in one cupboard of the kitchen and uses it to get to the lamp.

She finds the lamp and unscrews the bulb, then goes into the lower hall where she finds a matching bulb, but it's too hot to touch. She fetches a cleaning cloth from the kitchen and unscrews it with that.

Upon screwing in the bulb into her lamp again, the light immediately flashes on and she sees, that the lamp hangs on a sturdy hook. There's also something on the hook, but it's too tiny to see.

She finds a magnifying glass in a drawer in the kitchen.

She inspects the hook with the magnifying glass and finds hemp fibres. Slowly she realizes, that somebody tries to scare her and that the noose actually *was* there on the evening of day 1.

She wants to investigate, if somebody left fingerprints there. She suspects *REBECA*.

#### Morning

*MARJORIE* and *CALVIN* sit and eat breakfast. *REBECA* is at the now open cupboard in the living room. *CALVIN* tells her to join them, to which she reluctantly agrees to. She leaves the cupboard open.

As they are eating, *MARJORIE* tries to grill *REBECA* to find out wether she tries to scare her. At the same time, *REBECA* tries to test Calvin to find out more. They get into an argue, *CALVIN* gets in between and something he says triggers something in *REBECA*, so she backs off and tells him that she will go shopping and leaves (the cupboard is still open)

After breakfast, *MARJORIE* again takes the dishes to the kitchen. She wonders that the supplies seem to be fully stocked.

In the trash she finds a make-up brush.

She additionally gathers adhesive tape from a drawer in the hall, the fingerprint powder from the unlocked cupboard.

As she's back in her room after getting all the things, *BRIANNA* arrives and she is interrupted.

#### Noon

*BRIANNA* visits and *MARJORIE* questions her about *REBECA*.

#### Evening

In the meantime, *REBECA* is back. *MARJORIE* gets the fingerprints from the hook and tricks *REBECA* into drinking from a glass that *MARJORIE* snatches and gets her fingerprints off.

She compares the fingerprints and they match. She's now convinced, that *REBECA* is trying to scare her.

### Day 4

#### Early morning

*MARJORIE* wakes up to the sound of a fight. She walks down to find *CALVIN* shooting *REBECA*. *CALVIN* turns around and goes at her. In fear, she turns around and runs into her room and pushes a cupboard in front of her door.

*CALVIN* at first tries to sweet talk her, but ultimatively looses his nerves and screams at her. He shoots and pushes against the door. The cupboard moves and the door opens. *CALVIN* comes in, but is gunned down by the wounded *REBECA*, who breaks down.

*MARJORIE* talks to her, gets a cloth and *REBECA*s mobile from the kitchen, gives the cloth to *REBECA* to still the wound and calls 911.

### Day 5

#### Afternoon

*MARJORIE* sits with *BRIANNA*. They talk about *CALVIN*. In the end, *MARJORIE* confirms to *BRIANNA*, that she will appear in court and make her testimony.

The end.

## Scenes

Over the black starting credits, we hear a car driving over the pebbels of a driveway. The engine is turned off, we hear three people exiting the car. Doors slam, the trunk is opened. They walk up the pathway, we hear keys jingling, slided into a door. The door is unlocked, the people walk through and slam the door.

Fade in: "Day 1", Fade out.

### DAY1 - HALL - MORNING

*MARJORIE*, *CALVIN* and *REBECA* stand in the `HALL`, in front of the front door. We see a bagpack, a bag and a suitcase in front of them. The bagpack belongs to *CALVIN*, the bag to *REBECA* and the suitcase to *MARJORIE*.

They stand there for a few seconds, looking around. *MARJORIE* is frightened, she is taking in the uncommon surroundings. *REBECA* is annoyed, she is filling out a form.

*AMBIENT: Filling out a form*

*CALVIN* calmly looks around.

> *MARJORIE*

(beat) *AMBIENT: (stop)*

*MARJORIE* grabs her suitcase.

### DAY1 - BEDROOM - MORNING

*MUSIC: *MARJORIE* theme. Calming, relaxed*

*MARJORIE* enters the `BEDROOM`, looks around, then puts her `suitcase` on the bed, opens it.

*SFX: Suitcase on bed, opening suitcase*

*Cutscene ends*

#### PUZZLE 1.1: Unpack

Click on the `suitcase`.

> *MARJORIE*

* Sweaters (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

* Today's newspaper (Featuring a big article about the trial of *IGINO* *and* various other readable articles) (SFX: Unfolding paper)

When *MARJORIE* unpacks the pants, her `smartphone` falls out and smashes on the floor into four pieces: (*SFX: Object crashing on floor*)

* `smartphone_incomplete`

* `battery`

* `cover`

* `simcard`

They slide in all directions.

> *MARJORIE* (shouts)
> 
> DAMN.

#### PUZZLE 1.2: Assembling the phone

Find the four items by examining the things in the `BEDROOM`:

* `bed`
  Finding the `smartphone_incomplete` underneath it:
  
  > *MARJORIE*
  > 
  > Oh, there's the phone.
  
  Add `smartphone_incomplete`

* `wardrobe` (finding the `simcard` in front of it)
  
  > *MARJORIE*
  > 
  > There's that tiny phone card.
  
  Add `simcard`

  Add `cover`

* `stool` (finding the `battery`)
  
  > *MARJORIE*
  > 
  > Ah, there's the battery.

> *MARJORIE*
> 
> I think that's all.

Combine the items with the `smartphone_incomplete`:

* `simcard` (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

* `battery` (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

* `cover` (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

> *MARJORIE*
> 
> There. It works again.

* Toiletries bag (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

* Underwear (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

* Bras (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

Open the `purse`. Closeup of the `purse` contains:

* Picture of *MARJORIE*s mother
  
  > *MARJORIE*
  > 
  > My mom

* Small amount of money
  
  > *MARJORIE*
  > 
  > I never carry around much cash, I use the credit card usually.

* Credit card
  
  > *MARJORIE*
  > 
  > My card

* `Hairpin`
  
  > *MARJORIE*
  > 
  > That may be useful.

* A note
  
  > *MARJORIE*
  > 
  > Oh, that's my secret note. Yeah, I know you shouldn't write your passwords down, but my brain's a sieve. I wrote down
  > 
  > 4872
  > 
  > RUBE
  > 
  > caTerp1llar

Take the `hairpin` and use it to reset the `smartphone`.

> *MARJORIE*
> 
> It's a bit too big for the hole, a paper clip would be better. (beat) But... (tries) yes, it works.
> 
> Here we go.
> 
> (beat)
> 
> Ugh, now what was my PIN again? I always forget stuff like that.

#### PUZZLE 1.4: Finding the PIN

*SFX: Dialtones, when buttons on phone are pressed*

Using 4872 as the pin yields:

> *MARJORIE*
> 
> No, that's my credit card pin. I can remember that, because I use it more often.

Using RUBE(=7823) as the pin solves the puzzle

### DAY1 - BEDROOM - MORNING

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: The music gets dramatic and will culmulate when *REBECA* finds *MARJORIE*, then it underlines the shouting of *REBECA* and emotions of *MARJORIE*, ending with a dramatic *MARJORIE* theme line and a hard stop*

*MARJORIE* dials (*SFX: Dialtones*). After some moments, we hear:

> *MARJORIE* (very emotional)
> 
> Mom? (beat) Hi, Mom. Yes, we arrived. (beat) Oh, it's okay, I guess. We're (...)

We hear *REBECA* from the outside:

> *REBECA*
> 
> *MARJORIE*, I have some shee...

*REBECA* has entered the door and sees her on the phone.

> *REBECA* (shouting)
> 
> YOU IDIOT!

She rushes to *MARJORIE*, grabs the phone, rips of the SIM card, throws it out of the window and hides the phone. *MARJORIE* starts to cry.

> *REBECA* (shouting)
> 
> WHAT PART OF WITNESS PROTECTION DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND, DUMBASS?

She walks up and down the room.

> *REBECA*
> 
> NOT only that I WASTE MY TIME AND FUCKING RISK MY LIFE babysitting her, she goes about and brings a FUCKING PHONE TO HER SAFE HOUSE.

She turns around, pointing at *MARJORIE*

> *REBECA* (getting really mean)
> 
> DO YOU WANT HIM TO KILL YOU RIGHT AWAY? WE COULD ALL SAVE SOME TIME IN THAT CASE.

(beat, we hear *MARJORIE* sobbing)

She exists the room, slamming the door. (*SFX: Door slam*, *Music: Stops*)

*Fadeout*

*CALVIN* smiles at *MARJORIE*.

*MARJORIE* shyly smiles back.

> *MARJORIE*
> 
> Thank you.

*MARJORIE* turns to *REBECA*.

> *MARJORIE*
> 
> And I'm sorry. Bringing the phone really was a dumb idea. I just... I just miss my mom and yes, this is all very creepy for me.

> *REBECA*
> 
> Yeah, whatever. Just try to not get killed, okay?
> 
> (beat)
>

They have finished eating.

*MARJORIE* exits the living room, goes through the `HALL`, up the stairs, through the `UPPER_HALL` into the `BEDROOM` to find...

A noose dangling from the lamp. 

*MUSIC: horror string slide merging into MARJORIE tune*

*MARJORIE* screams, then runs out of the `BEDROOM`, down the stairs. In the `HALL`, she bumps into *CALVIN*.

*REBECA* snaps out, then exits the room. *CALVIN* looks after her.

*MARJORIE* sobs.

*Fadeout*

### DAY 2 - MORNING - LIVING ROOM

Fade in: "Day 2", Fade out.

*Cutscene ends*

*MUSIC: *CALVIN*-theme, calm*

*AMBIENT: Eating sounds*

*MARJORIE*, *CALVIN* and *REBECA* are having breakfast at the table. There's toast, scrambled eggs, bacon and jam. The bacon is next to *REBECA*. *CALVIN* reads a "New York Standard" paper and randomly sips from a cup of coffee, *REBECA* is eating Muesli out of a bowl and staring out of the window. *MARJORIE* tries to make conversation.

A [dialog](dialogs/day2breakfast.md) unfolds.

*Cutscene starts*

After it, we fade out, and fade in again. *REBECA* now sits against the wall with the hatch, reading a file. *CALVIN* has put the paper on the desk and reads. *MARJORIE* stands.

*MUSIC: *MARJORIE*-theme, calm*

> *MARJORIE*
> 
> Let me put myself to use and clean this up.

> *CALVIN*
> 
> Thank you, *MARJORIE*.

*Cutscene ends*

The player can explore freely now. 

(Optional) Take the `day2_dishes` and the `day2_leftovers` from the table. Go into the `KITCHEN`. Put the `day2_leftovers` into the `trash_can`, clean the `day2_dishes` in the `kitchen_sink`.

They have to complete the following puzzles:

#### PUZZLE 2.1: The Diary

Go up to `BEDROOM`, find the `gruesome_note`.

Solve the note puzzle to get the combination.

Open the `padlock` at the `drawer` using the combination. Find the `diary`. Read the `diary`.
Go to the `LIVING_ROOM` and [talk to *REBECA*](dialogs/rebeca2.md).

#### PUZZLE 2.2: Getting the phone back

Go into the `KITCHEN` and look through the `hatch`. The scene is switched to `LIVING_ROOM` with *MARJORIE* looking through the hatch. Wait for the right moment to snatch the `smartphone` out of *REBECA*s `pocket`.

#### PUZZLE 2.3: Finding the wifi router

Turn on the `smartphone`, it shows no mobile connection, but an accessible wifi. Connecting to it requires a password though.

The wifi signal display is set to 2 of 4 bars in the `KITCHEN` and the `LIVING ROOM`. It shows 3 of 4 bars in the `HALL` and the `BEDROOM`. It shows 4 of 4 bars in the `UPPER HALL`.

Looking at the `smartphone` and selecting the wifi signal in the  `UPPER HALL`  reveals a `loose_board`. It can be pried loose using a `knife` from the `KITCHEN`. Under the `loose_board` the `wifi_router` is revealed. When turning it around, a wifi password is revealed. 

*SFX: mobile keyboard sounds while typing the following* 

Entering into the `smartphone` doesn't work though.

In the `trash_can` in the `KITCHEN` you find the `password_note`, which, combined with the password under the `wifi_router`,  reveals the actual wifi password. Enter it in the `smartphone` to connect to the wifi.

*MARJORIE*  puts down the `smartphone`. Blackout.

### DAY 2 - AFTERNOON - LIVING ROOM

*MUSIC: *BRIANNA* theme. Soft, calming*

*MARJORIE* sits on the sofa with *BRIANNA*. *BRIANNA*'s open suitcase lies on the couch table, *BRIANNA* opened a big folder on her lap. *MARJORIE* is nervous.

[They talk.](dialogs/brianna2.md)

### DAY 2 - NIGHT - BEDROOM

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: None*

*AMBIENT: None*

It's night. We see the `BEDROOM` only lit from the windows to the left. We see part of the bed with very hard shadows. *MARJORIE* lies in the bed. After a few seconds, Marjorie wakes up and rises in bed.

*SOUND: Creaking bed*

Suddenly, the bedroom is lit up, we see *IGINO* standing in the door, slowly rising a gun. *MARJORIE* opens her mouth as if to scream, but no scream is heard.

*MUSIC: Panic!*

### DAY 3 - EARLY MORNING - BEDROOM

We switch back to the dark `BEDROOM` and barely see the small explosion of the lightbulb, which makes a *SOUND: Plop*, which makes it blur to the gun scene.

*MUSIC: None*

*MARJORIE* startles up, screams. Then realizes, that she's safe. *MARJORIE* rises. She tries to turn on the `lamp` using the `light_switch`, which doesn't work.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> Hm. Guess the bulb's dead.

*Cutscene ends*

*MUSIC: Eerie, very few notes. "Night atmosphere". Not too scary though.*

#### PUZZLE 3.1 - Fixing the lamp

Go into the `KITCHEN`, get the `stepladder` from one of the `cupboard`s. Use the `stepladder` with the `lamp`. *MARJORIE* walks up the `stepladder` and unscrews the `broken_bulb`.

You can use the `broken_bulb` with all the lights in the house. Only a lamp in the  `HALL` matches. But it's too hot to touch. Find a `cloth` in the `KITCHEN` and use it to unscrew the `bulb`.

Screw the `bulb` into the `lamp` in the `BEDROOM`.

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: Get's more eerie and downright scary*

The light flashes on and *MARJORIE* gasps, startles, leans back and falls down the `stepladder` onto the floor.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> What the-?

She rises again, climbs the `stepladder` again and looks up. The screen switches to the closeup of the lamp: We see, that the lamps hangs on a study metallic hook.

*MUSIC: Horror strings*

> *MARJORIE*
>
> That's... that's the hook the noose was hanging from. Are you fucking kidding me?
>
> What's that on the hook?

*MUSIC: back to "Night atmosphere"*

*Cutscene ends*

#### PUZZLE 3.2 - Inspecting the hook

Get the `magnifying_glass` from a `drawer` in the `KITCHEN`.

Use the `magnifying_glass` with the `tiny_thing` on the hook.

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: Marjorie theme, will swell up during her monologue, then cut off when Marjorie shuts off the light*

> *MARJORIE*
>
> What. The. Fuck? That's hemp. So there *was* an actual noose hanging here?

*MARJORIE* climbs down the ladder and goes up and down the room.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> I can't believe it. That's... (back and forth) but... but why? (back and forth) Is it about my testimony? (back and forth) I can't fucking believe it. (stops in the middle of the room) Does she want to scare me? Is she involved in this? (goes to the light switch) Nuh-uh, bitch. You can't scare me. Not. (hand on the light switch)

Blackout.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> Me.

### DAY 3 - MORNING - LIVING ROOM

*MUSIC: Marjorie theme, jazzy background*

*MARJORIE* and *CALVIN* sit and eat breakfast. *REBECA* is at the now open cupboard in the living room, fiddling around with its contents.

> *CALVIN*
>
> Rebeca? Are you coming?

No answer.

> *CALVIN*
>
> *Rebeca*?

> *REBECA* (grunts)
>
> *Fine*.

She comes over without locking the cupboard, drops down at the table and starts munching Muesli again.

A [dialog](dialogs/day3breakfast.md) unfolds.

> *CALVIN*
>
> Ladies, please!

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) I WOULD IF YOU WOULD TRY TO GROW UP, MISSY!

> *CALVIN*
>
> (louder) *Ladies!*

> *MARJORIE*
>
> (shouting) OH I'D GROW UP IF YOU WOULD BE MORE EMPATHIC THAN  A BLOCK OF...

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) LADIES! CAN WE PLEASE CALM DOWN AGAIN?

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) TELL THAT TO HER!

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) I'M TELLING THAT TO EACH OF YOU. STOP THAT! I DON'T WANT TO LOCK YOU UP IN YOUR ROOMS LIKE I DID WITH JACOB!

Quiet. *REBECA* stares at *CALVIN*. Seconds pass.

> *REBECA*
>
> (snaps out of it, looks around) We need groceries.

*REBECA* storms off. Seconds pass.

> *CALVIN*
>
> I'm... I'm sorry.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> No, please. I'm sorry. This was... I was...

> *CALVIN*
>
> It's okay, Marjorie. It's really hard, I know.

Seconds pass. *CALVIN* starts to clean the table.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> Ah, you know what? Why don't you sit down and I take care of the dishes again? As an apology.

> *CALVIN*
>
> You don't need to apologize, you know?

> *MARJORIE*
>
> Thank you, but still... I just need something to do.

> *CALVIN*
>
> Okay then. Thank you.

He sits down again.

*Cutscene ends*

* Take the `day3_dishes` and clean them in the `KITCHEN`

#### PUZZLE 3.3: Getting the fingerprint kit

Take the `makeup_brush` from the trashcan in the kitchen. Take the `tape` from a `drawer` in the `HALL`. Get the `fingerprint_powder` from the `cupboard_unlocked` in the `LIVINGROOM`.

Go to the `BEDROOM`.

*Cutscene starts*

*SOUND: closing door* 

> *BRIANNA*
>
> (shouting up) Marjorie? I'm here.

Marjorie takes a look at the lamp, sighs.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> *Coming!*

### DAY 3 - NOON - LIVING ROOM

*MUSIC: *BRIANNA* theme. Soft, calming*

*MARJORIE* sits on the sofa with *BRIANNA*. *BRIANNA*'s open suitcase lies on the couch table, *BRIANNA* opened a big folder on her lap. *MARJORIE* is nervous.

They talk.

### DAY 3 - EVENING - LIVING ROOM

*REBECA* reenters the `LIVINGROOM`, she seems confused.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> (suspicious) Got everything you wanted? (referring to getting groceries)

*REBECA* subtly startles and looks at *MARJORIE*

> *REBECA*
>
> Huh?

> *MARJORIE*
>
> The groceries?

> *REBECA*
>
> (still confused) Gro- (realizes) oh yeah. Yeah.

*REBECA* exits the `LIVINGROOM` and enters the `KITCHEN`.

#### PUZZLE 3.4: Lifting fingerprints

Go to the `BEDROOM`. Combine the following items:

* `tape`
* `fingerprint_powder`
* `makeup_brush`

This will yield the `makeshift_fingerprint_kit`.

Use the `makeshift_fingerprint_kit` with the `hook` to get `hook_fingerprints`.

#### PUZZLE 3.5: Getting fingerprints from Rebeca

Go to the `KITCHEN`. *REBECA* stands to the right, looking out the window.

[Talk to Rebeca](dialogs/rebeca3.md)

Use the `smartphone` to search for a recipe for a virgin mary.

* `tomatoes` and `jalapeno_peppers` from the fridge in the `KITCHEN`
* `hammer` from a drawer in the `HALL`

Combine:

* `lemon` with `knife` to get `half_lemon`
* `half_lemon` with `glass`
* `salt` with `glass`
* `pepper` with `glass`
* `knife` with `jalapeno_peppers` to get `cut_peppers`
* `cut_peppers` with `glass`

After combining `mashed_tomatoes`, `half_lemon`, `salt`, `pepper`and `cut_peppers` are combined with `glass` the player gets the `makeshift_virgin_mary`.

Give `makeshift_virgin_mary` to *REBECA*.

> *REBECA*
>
> Huh? What? Is that...

> *MARJORIE*
>
> A makeshift Virgin Mary. As a peace offer.

> *REBECA*
>
> That's... That's actually really nice. Thank you.

> *MARJORIE*
>
> You're welcome.

*REBECA* drinks.

##### Newspaper

A typical New York newspaper called "New York Standard". There's a big article with a photo of *IGINO*, and several articles around it.

The articles read:

**MOB BOSS ON TRIAL** by Tyrice Curtis

*IGINO* Varone (shown left), the alleged head of "La Famiglia", the New York based crime organization, will be on trial this friday afternoon after having been accused of killing a shop owner in the lower east side.

District Attorney *BRIANNA* Allison tells the New York Standard that she will aim for a life sentence. "We have solid evidence", Misses Allison says, "We also have a witness, so I have no doubt that the jury will rule in our favor. It's time that we put an end to the business of La Famiglia!"

The trial will start on Friday, 4pm, court room 10.

**HOMELESS SHELTER GOES UP IN FLAMES** by Jasmine Guyot

East village - a building used as a homeless shelter burnt down to the ground yesterday evening. Officer Mike Greyson, who was the first at the crime scene, told the New York Standard that arson can not be ruled out at this point. Until the police has other leads, the remains of the shelter will be treated as a crime scene. It's recommended to stay clear of the area due to the probable instability of the building. The gruesome numbers are as of yet: 12 casualties, 34 people with burn injuries, that have been taken to Beth Israel Hospital.

**VISIT SWEDEN! A TRAVEL COMMENTARY** by Carol Reed

New York Standard's own Carol Reed is travelling Europe and reports all about the nicest destinations in the old world.

This time, Carol visits the town of NorrkÃ¶ping, just about 120 miles east of Stockholm, Sweden's capital. Read all about Sweden's wonderful countryside and art on page 14.

**POLICE NOTICES**

New York City police are investigating after a dumpster was found Monday night filled with dozens of pounds of cocaine. Police says the 60 pounds of cocaine was estimated to be worth $6.6 million.
A person, suspected of a crime related to the incident, is held in police custody awaiting a court hearing.

#### `diary`

The diary is just an old ring-bound notepad with ballpen scriblings on it. They are readable of course, but show the rising pressure and tension of the writer. It's fake though. It wasn't *actually* written by Jacob Grimes, it's something Calvin uses to scare Marjorie. Each day starts a new page.

On the first page it reads: "JAYGEE's diary"

##### Tuesday

The attorney said I should write this. It may help me to concentrate. I never wrote a diary and it feels weird. Anyways, here goes.

It's okay here. The house is nice. But I don't want to be here. Why the hell did I need to tag that wall on Cooper Avenue? Couldn't I just stay home? Just for one fucking night?

Bah. It's soooooo boring. There's nothing to do.

The cops are alright though. They are nice.

##### Wednesday

If I wouldn't be out there I wouldn't have seen that Italian killing Derek. I guess, Derek was fucking with La Famiglia's business in the Bronx. That idiot.

And then I even went to the cops. ME! What was I thinking? And now, La Famiglia is on my ass. I can feel it. They don't want me speaking up.

I hope I'm safe here. The house is not nice. It's creepy. It's fucking with my head.

##### Thursdy

Fuck!  I'm not safe here. The cops are no help. The Famiglia bastards are on their way. I can feel it.

They want my head. They don't accept if somebody speaks up. They're far too powerful. They're everywhere.

Fuck! FUCK!

##### Frid

They're downstairs, damnit! I can hear them. They're calling me. THEY WANT MY HEAD.  

But I won't let them. No, sir. I'm gonna lock my room.

#### `gruesome_note`

The gruesome note is a worn-out paper with what appears to be an eerie child poem that goes like this:

The itsy, bitsy spider
went up the pyramid
down came the sphere
and rolled right over it.

Then fell the cube and
crushed it right and then, so
the really ugly spider
could never climb again.
