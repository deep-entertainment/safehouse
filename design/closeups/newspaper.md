District Attorney [brianna](characters/brianna.md) Allison tells the New York Standard that she will aim for a life sentence. "We have solid evidence", Misses Allison says, "We also have a witness, so I have no doubt that the jury will rule in our favor. It's time that we put an end to the business of La Famiglia!"

**HOMELESS SHELTER GOES UP IN FLAMES** by Jasmine Guyot

East Village - a building used as a homeless shelter burnt down to the ground yesterday evening. Officer Mike Greyson, who was the first at the crime scene, told the New York Standard that arson can not be ruled out at this point. Until the police has other leads, the remains of the shelter will be treated as a crime scene. It's recommended to stay clear of the area due to the probable instability of the building. The gruesome numbers are as of yet 12 casualties and 34 people with burn injuries, that have been taken to Beth Israel Hospital.
