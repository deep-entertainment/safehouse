# Wifi Router

#closeup 

A WIFI router. There are cables going into the sides and there are two antennas at the top.

On the front is a vendor logo. It's two rectangles side by side (symbolizing the [Leverkusen Rhine Bridge](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinbr%C3%BCcke_Leverkusen)) and the name "Levku". Under the logo sits the model name "AirComm 1155". In the lower right corner, we see leds showing Power, Connect, LAN and WIFI. Power and Connect are static green, LAN is off and WIFI is blinking irregularly.

The WIFI router can be turned around. On the back is a sticky note with "WIFI-PASSWORD: GERONIMO" scribbled upon.
