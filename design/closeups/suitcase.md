# Suitcase

#closeup 

An open, small, black [suitcase](../items/suitcase.md) for Marjorie's stay in the house. We see into it, it's neatly and cleanly packed.

There is a stack of items upon each other, which can be clicked and trigger responses. Each click plays [wardrobe_moving](../sfx/wardrobe_moving.md) and removes the item

The exit leads to [bedroom](../locations/bedroom.md)

# Unpacking

Those items are presented in order:

- Shirts
- Sweaters
- Today's newspaper. Swiches to [newspaper](closeups/newspaper.md) (Play [unfolding_paper](sfx/unfolding_paper.md))
- Pants
