# Screens

## PIN screen

Used at [PUZZLE 1 4 Finding the PIN](../gdd.md#PUZZLE%201%204%20Finding%20the%20PIN)

Shows "Please enter the PIN of your SIM card" with standard number buttons with characters.

Pressing the number buttons plays [dialtones](../sfx/touchtones.md).

When the right PIN (buttons of characters for RUBE(=7823)) is entered, we shortly see the dashboard.

There's a big analog clock showing 11:55. Under it we see the following icons in two rows of three:

- Mail
- Browser
- Photos
- Music
- Game icon from Mikael's new game
- Messenger

On the top border we see a wifi symbol and a cellular sign of the provider "Merscom".

## Finding wifi

Used at [PUZZLE 2 3 Finding the wifi router](../gdd.md#PUZZLE%202%203%20Finding%20the%20wifi%20router)

We shortly see the dashboard, then the WIFI-symbol is highlighted (as if touched) and the screen changes to a list of WIFIs with a strength indicator.

The WIFI Bluth1155 is the only one shown.

The wifi signal display is set to 2 of 4 bars in the [kitchen](locations/kitchen.md) and the [living_room](locations/living_room.md). It shows 3 of 4 bars in the [hall](locations/hall.md) and the [bedroom](locations/bedroom.md). It shows 4 of 4 bars in the [upper_hall](locations/upper_hall.md).

The wifi can be clicked, upon which a prompt asks for "Please enter WIFI password for Bluth1155".

A virtual keyboard (only characters) is displayed. Pressing its keys plays [key_sounds](../sfx/key_sounds.md)

The password is IMOGERON (GERONIMO, the password from the router rotated 3 characters alphabetically to the right as hinted by [password_note](../items/password_note.md))

After the password is entered, see [PUZZLE 2 3 Finding the wifi router](../gdd.md#PUZZLE%202%203%20Finding%20the%20wifi%20router).
