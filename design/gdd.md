## Abstract

A mob murder witness is taken into a safe house by the police for five days before her court appearance. She's protected by two police officers. One of them is on the mob murder's payroll and has already staged a suicide of a witness 18 years ago. He first tries to scare the witness with the story about the suicide by leaving scary notes and intimidating her. On the fourth day, his masquerade is dropped, and he first tries to kill the other officer. The witness interrupts him, and then he tries to kill her, but she can hold him back and is saved in the last minute by the other officer.

## Characters

- [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
- [calvin](characters/calvin.md)
- [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md)
- [brianna](characters/brianna.md)
- [igino](characters/igino.md)
- [jacob](characters/jacob.md)

## Music

The idea for the music is, that the characters Marjorie, Calvin and Brianna have themes. Each of these themes have different variations and reprises that are used throughout the game to gently hint which character is currently in focus of the game.

The themes should reflect the character's personality or functions in the game:

- [Marjorie](music/marjorie.md#Marjorie)
- [Calvin](music/calvin.md#Calvin)
- [Brianna](music/brianna.md#Brianna)

## Game structure

The game is structured by chapters for each day. The chapters aren't visible to the player though, and can only be distinguished by the change of scenery with morning/noon/evening/night scenes.

This is a short overview of the different scenes:

### Day 1

#### Morning

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md), [calvin](characters/calvin.md) and [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) arrive at the safe house in New Jersey. They make themselves at home. [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) goes upstairs in her bedroom to unpack. She has smuggled a phone into the safe house and calls her mother, gets interrupted by [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md), who screams at her, grabs her phone and storms off.

#### Noon

They talk over the dinner about what happened. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) tries to comfort [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md). [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) is still irked at Marjorie.

#### Afternoon

[brianna](characters/brianna.md) visits and reveals the [igino](characters/igino.md) backstory.

#### Evening

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) goes up to her room to find a noose hanging from the ceiling. She screams, runs away and bumps into [calvin](characters/calvin.md) in the hall. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) calms her down, tells her to wait in the hall, goes into her room and quickly removes the noose (unknown to the player). At the same time, [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) arrives and rushes up behind [calvin](characters/calvin.md).

[calvin](characters/calvin.md) and [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) come back and tell [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) that there's no noose and she must have been hallucinating. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) manages to calm her down. [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) is strangely quiet and absent minded.

### Day 2

#### Morning

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md), [calvin](characters/calvin.md) and [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) eat breakfast. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) reads the New York Standard. In the dialog, [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) tries to gather more information about [igino](characters/igino.md) and La Famiglia.

After finishing the breakfast, [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) goes into her room and finds a gruesome drawing with an eerie children's poem on her bed, which ultimatively leads her to the combination of the padlock on the drawer in her room.

She opens the lock with it and finds the fake diary of [jacob](characters/jacob.md) Grimes. Downstairs, she finds [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) and talks to her. She reveals that [jacob](characters/jacob.md) Grimes was found dead 18 years ago. (It is not yet revealed, that [jacob](characters/jacob.md) hung himself or that [calvin](characters/calvin.md) was assigned to that case)

As [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) doesn't tell her more, [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) wants to investigate. She needs her phone for that.

[rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) sits on the couch, [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)'s phone sticking out of one of her pockets. [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) needs to walk into the kitchen and look through the hatch to get it in the right moment.

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)'s SIM is gone, so she needs wifi. There actually is wifi in the house used by the detectives, but it's locked.

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) traces the wifi signal to a loose board in the upstairs hall. She gets a knife from the kitchen and pries open the board to find the router. She turns the router around to finds a password. It isn't the right one, though. A paper in the junk in the kitchen shows how to decipher it.

She logs into the wifi and searches for "[jacob](characters/jacob.md) Grimes" to find that he had hung himself in her room 18 years ago and that [calvin](characters/calvin.md) was assigned to that case.

#### Afternoon

[brianna](characters/brianna.md) visits and [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) asks her about [jacob](characters/jacob.md)'s story.

#### Night

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) wakes up from a sound, sits up in her bed and sees [igino](characters/igino.md) in the doorway, aiming a gun at her. He shoots and she wakes up and quickly sits up, gasping. It's early morning in day 3.

### Day 3

#### Early morning

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) sits in her bed. Her room is dark, only the dim light of the windows sheds some light into their side of the room.

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) gets up to find the light switch, but the lamp can't be turned on since the bulb has blown.

She finds the lamp, but it's too high for her. She finds a stepladder in one cupboard of the kitchen and uses it to get to the lamp.

She unscrews the bulb in the lamp, and then goes into the lower hall where she finds a matching bulb, which is too hot to touch. She fetches a cleaning cloth from the kitchen, and unscrews it with that.

Upon screwing in the bulb into her lamp again, the light immediately switches on, and she sees that the lamp hangs on a sturdy hook. There's also something on the hook, but it's too tiny to see.

She finds a magnifying glass in a drawer in the kitchen.

She inspects the hook with the magnifying glass and finds hemp fibres. Slowly she realizes, that somebody tries to scare her and that the noose actually *was* there on the evening of day 1.

She wants to investigate if somebody left fingerprints there. She suspects [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md).

#### Morning

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) and [calvin](characters/calvin.md) sit and eat breakfast. [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) is at the now open cupboard in the living room. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) tells her to join them, to which she reluctantly agrees to. She leaves the cupboard open.

As they are eating, [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) tries to grill [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) to find out wether she tries to scare her. At the same time, [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) tries to test Calvin to find out more. They get into an argument. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) gets in between them and something he says triggers something in [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md), so she backs off and tells him that she will go shopping and leaves (the cupboard is still open)

After breakfast, [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) again takes the dishes to the kitchen. She wonders why the supplies seem to be fully stocked.

In the trash she finds a make-up brush.

She additionally gathers adhesive tape from a drawer in the hall, and the fingerprint powder from the unlocked cupboard.

As she's back in her room after getting all the things, [brianna](characters/brianna.md) arrives and she is interrupted.

#### Noon

[brianna](characters/brianna.md) visits and [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) questions her about [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md).

#### Evening

In the meantime, [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) is back. [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) gets the fingerprints from the hook and tricks [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) into drinking from a glass that [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) snatches and gets her fingerprints off.

She compares the fingerprints, and they match. She's now convinced that [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) is trying to scare her.

### Day 4

#### Early morning

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) wakes up to the sound of a fight. She walks down to find [calvin](characters/calvin.md) shooting [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md). [calvin](characters/calvin.md) turns around and comes at her. In fear, she turns around and runs into her room and pushes a cupboard in front of her door.

[calvin](characters/calvin.md) first tries to sweet-talk her, but ultimatively looses his nerves and screams at her. He shoots and pushes against the door. The cupboard moves and the door opens. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) comes in, but is gunned down by the wounded [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md), who breaks down.

### Day 5

#### Afternoon

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) sits with [brianna](characters/brianna.md). They talk about [calvin](characters/calvin.md). In the end, [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) confirms to [brianna](characters/brianna.md) that she will appear in court and make her testimony.

The end.

The wifi signal display is set to 2 of 4 bars in the [kitchen](locations/kitchen.md) and the `LIVING ROOM`. It shows 3 of 4 bars in the [hall](locations/hall.md) and the [bedroom](locations/bedroom.md). It shows 4 of 4 bars in the `UPPER HALL`.

Looking at the [smartphone](items/smartphone.md) and selecting the wifi signal in the  `UPPER HALL`  reveals a [upper_hall_loose_board](items/upper_hall_loose_board.md). It can be pried loose using a [knife](items/knife.md) from the [kitchen](locations/kitchen.md). Under the [upper_hall_loose_board](items/upper_hall_loose_board.md) the [upper_hall_wifi_router](items/upper_hall_wifi_router.md) is revealed. Using it switches to [wifi router](closeups/wifi_router.md) When turning it around, a wifi password is revealed.

Entering the password as-is into the [smartphone](closeups/smartphone.md) doesn't work though.

In the [kitchen_trash_can](items/kitchen_trash_can.md) you find the [password_note](items/password_note.md), which, mentally combined with the password under the [upper_hall_wifi_router](items/upper_hall_wifi_router.md),  reveals the actual wifi password. Enter it into the [smartphone](items/smartphone.md) to connect to the wifi.

### DAY 3 - EARLY MORNING - BEDROOM

We switch back to the dark [bedroom](locations/bedroom.md) and barely see the small explosion of the lightbulb, which makes a [plop](sfx/plop.md), which makes it blur to the gun scene.

### DAY 4 - EARLY MORNING - BEDROOM

No music.

We fadein to the night view of the [bedroom](locations/bedroom.md) and see [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) sleeping.

After some seconds, we hear glass breaking downstairs and [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) startles up.

We hear muffled shouts from downstairs.

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) gets up.

*Cutscene ends*

Go down into the [living_room](locations/living_room.md) to see light in the kitchen and the door opened. Here, we can clearly hear the shouting:

Music: [Calvin revealing](music/calvin.md#Calvin%20revealing)

*Cutscene starts*

> [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md)

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) ducks down and slowly approaches the kitchen.

> [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md)
>
> (shouting) And that would make you switch sides? Money? Come on, Calvin! That's so cliché!

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) reaches the kitchen and we switch to the [kitchen](locations/kitchen.md) with her looking in. [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) has backed up to the right side of the screen. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) is in the middle of the room.

[calvin](characters/calvin.md) raises a gun at [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md). [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) screams. We quickly switch back to the [living_room](locations/living_room.md). A shot is heard.

Music: [Calvin chasing](music/calvin.md#Calvin%20chasing)

Play [gunshot](sfx/gunshot.md)

*Cutscene ends*

#### PUZZLE 4.1: Survive!

From this on we need to hurry. Staying in the [living_room](locations/living_room.md), the [hall](locations/hall.md), the [upper hall](locations/upper_hall.md) or the (unboarded) [bedroom](locations/bedroom.md) more than 5 seconds will make [calvin](characters/calvin.md) appear and shoot. If that happens, we're taken back to the beginning of this puzzle.

Go through the [hall](locations/hall.md), the [upper hall](locations/upper_hall.md) into the [bedroom](locations/bedroom.md). Close the [bedroom_door](items/bedroom_door.md) and use the [bedroom_wardrobe](items/bedroom_wardrobe.md) to push it in front of the door.

*Cutscene starts*

Music: [Calvin switching](music/calvin.md#Calvin%20switching)

[marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) goes to the left of her room. Then we hear [calvin](characters/calvin.md) banging on the [bedroom_door](items/bedroom_door.md).

> Well, a man's gotta provide for himself!

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>

> Ahh, the kid.

[calvin](characters/calvin.md) banging on the [bedroom_door](items/bedroom_door.md). The [bedroom_wardrobe](items/bedroom_wardrobe.md) moves some step away, the [bedroom_door](items/bedroom_door.md) is visible.

> [calvin](characters/calvin.md)
>
> He just didn't get the message, that little punk.

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> (shouting) Why did you have to kill them?

> [calvin](characters/calvin.md)
>
> Because there was no other way!

[calvin](characters/calvin.md) banging on the [bedroom_door](items/bedroom_door.md). The [bedroom_wardrobe](items/bedroom_wardrobe.md) gives in, moves further away and the [bedroom_door](items/bedroom_door.md) swings open. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) comes in.

> [calvin](characters/calvin.md)
>
> It's the same with you. Why didn't you just chicken out like they usually do?

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> (shouting) Usually?
>
> (quiet) Usually do? How many times have you pulled these tricks?

> [calvin](characters/calvin.md)
>
> I've been in the force longer than you've been alive, missy.

[calvin](characters/calvin.md) steps a bit closer

> [calvin](characters/calvin.md)
>
> Igino Varone is a... busy man.

[calvin](characters/calvin.md) raises his gun.

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> (cries out) NO!

> [calvin](characters/calvin.md)
>
> You should have just been so petrified that you'd retract your testimony. But you're too stubborn for your own good.

[calvin](characters/calvin.md) points his gun at [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md).

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> (cries) nooo.

> [calvin](characters/calvin.md)
>
> So this is on you, Marjorie, I'm afraid. And poor Rebeca killed you. Ah well, what a mess.
>
> Goodbye, Marjorie.

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> NO!

The screen flashes white, a [gunshot](sfx/gunshot.md) is heard.

We see the [bedroom](locations/bedroom.md) again. [calvin](characters/calvin.md) still stands in the middle of the room, with the raised gun. [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md) is on the left.

Suddenly [calvin](characters/calvin.md) lowers his arm, we see blood on his shirt, he goes to his knees and then breaks down.

A wounded [rebeca](characters/rebeca.md) limps into the room, looks at [calvin](characters/calvin.md)s body, then breaks down as well.

Blackout.

> All because of that fuck.

Silence.

They laugh.

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> She saved my life.

> [brianna](characters/brianna.md)
>
> I guess so. She said, on that evening with the noose, Calvin came rushing out of your bedroom with something tacked in his suit, but when he came back it was gone.
>
> And then Calvin said something about locking you up.

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> (nodding) When we were fighting. I remember.

> [brianna](characters/brianna.md)
>
> Yes, and it came to Rebecas mind, that Jacob was locked up as well and then she really got suspicious and started to investigate.

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> (to herself) The groceries!

> [brianna](characters/brianna.md)
>
> What?

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)

> Rebeca said she was about to get groceries but the cupboards were full. She was investigating then.

> [brianna](characters/brianna.md)
>
> Yeah and the next morning they got into a... fight. But you know the details.

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> Yes. (pause)
>
> I need to apologize to Rebeca when she's out of the hospital. I suspected that the one trying to scare me was her. I even found her fingerprints on the hook in my room.

> [brianna](characters/brianna.md)
>
> I guess she did some investigating of her own there.

> [marjorie](characters/marjorie.md)
>
> I guess so.

Pause.

> [brianna](characters/brianna.md)
