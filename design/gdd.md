## Abstract

A mob murder witness is taken into a safe house by the police for five days before her court appearance. She's protected by two police officers. One of them is on the mob murder's payroll and has already staged a suicide of a witness 18 years ago. He first tries to scare the witness with the story about the suicide by leaving scary notes and intimidating her. On the fourth day, his masquerade is dropped, and he first tries to kill the other officer. The witness interrupts him, and then he tries to kill her, but she can hold him back and is saved in the last minute by the other officer.

*REBECA* is one of the two police officers that ought to protect [[marjorie]] in the safe house.

She's young, rough and harsh and she's not really happy spending five days "babysitting" [[marjorie]] like she puts it. She comes from a family tradition of police officers, and her father and grandfather were highly renowned police officers.

## Game structure

The game is structured by chapters for each day. The chapters aren't visible to the player though, and can only be distinguished by the change of scenery with morning/noon/evening/night scenes.

This is a short overview of the different scenes:

### Day 1

#### Morning

[[marjorie]], *CALVIN* and *REBECA* arrive at the safe house in New Jersey. They make themselves at home. [[marjorie]] goes upstairs in her bedroom to unpack. She has smuggled a phone into the safe house and calls her mother, gets interrupted by *REBECA*, who screams at her, grabs her phone and storms off.

#### Noon

They talk over the dinner about what happened. *CALVIN* tries to comfort [[marjorie]]. *REBECA* is still irked at Marjorie.

#### Afternoon

*BRIANNA* visits and reveals the *IGINO* backstory.

#### Evening

[[marjorie]] goes up to her room to find a noose hanging from the ceiling. She screams, runs away and bumps into *CALVIN* in the hall. *CALVIN* calms her down, tells her to wait in the hall, goes into her room and quickly removes the noose (unknown to the player). At the same time, *REBECA* arrives and rushes up behind *CALVIN*.

*CALVIN* and *REBECA* come back and tell [[marjorie]] that there's no noose and she must have been hallucinating. *CALVIN* manages to calm her down. *REBECA* is strangely quiet and absent minded.

### Day 2

#### Morning

[[marjorie]], *CALVIN* and *REBECA* eat breakfast. *CALVIN* reads the New York Standard. In the dialog, [[marjorie]] tries to gather more information about *IGINO* and La Famiglia.

After finishing the breakfast, [[marjorie]] goes into her room and finds a gruesome drawing with an eerie children's poem on her bed, which ultimatively leads her to the combination of the padlock on the drawer in her room.

She opens the lock with it and finds the fake diary of *JACOB* Grimes. Downstairs, she finds *REBECA* and talks to her. She reveals that *JACOB* Grimes was found dead 18 years ago. (It is not yet revealed, that *JACOB* hung himself or that *CALVIN* was assigned to that case)

As *REBECA* doesn't tell her more, [[marjorie]] wants to investigate. She needs her phone for that.

*REBECA* sits on the couch, [[marjorie]]'s phone sticking out of one of her pockets. [[marjorie]] needs to walk into the kitchen and look through the hatch to get it in the right moment.

[[marjorie]]'s SIM is gone, so she needs wifi. There actually is wifi in the house used by the detectives, but it's locked.

[[marjorie]] traces the wifi signal to a loose board in the upstairs hall. She gets a knife from the kitchen and pries open the board to find the router. She turns the router around to finds a password. It isn't the right one, though. A paper in the junk in the kitchen shows how to decipher it.

She logs into the wifi and searches for "*JACOB* Grimes" to find that he had hung himself in her room 18 years ago and that *CALVIN* was assigned to that case.

#### Afternoon

*BRIANNA* visits and [[marjorie]] asks her about *JACOB*'s story.

#### Night

[[marjorie]] wakes up from a sound, sits up in her bed and sees *IGINO* in the doorway, aiming a gun at her. He shoots and she wakes up and quickly sits up, gasping. It's early morning in day 3.

### Day 3

#### Early morning

[[marjorie]] sits in her bed. Her room is dark, only the dim light of the windows sheds some light into their side of the room.

[[marjorie]] gets up to find the light switch, but the lamp can't be turned on since the bulb has blown.

She finds the lamp, but it's too high for her. She finds a stepladder in one cupboard of the kitchen and uses it to get to the lamp.

She unscrews the bulb in the lamp, and then goes into the lower hall where she finds a matching bulb, which is too hot to touch. She fetches a cleaning cloth from the kitchen, and unscrews it with that.

Upon screwing in the bulb into her lamp again, the light immediately switches on, and she sees that the lamp hangs on a sturdy hook. There's also something on the hook, but it's too tiny to see.

She finds a magnifying glass in a drawer in the kitchen.

She inspects the hook with the magnifying glass and finds hemp fibres. Slowly she realizes, that somebody tries to scare her and that the noose actually *was* there on the evening of day 1.

She wants to investigate if somebody left fingerprints there. She suspects *REBECA*.

#### Morning

[[marjorie]] and *CALVIN* sit and eat breakfast. *REBECA* is at the now open cupboard in the living room. *CALVIN* tells her to join them, to which she reluctantly agrees to. She leaves the cupboard open.

As they are eating, [[marjorie]] tries to grill *REBECA* to find out wether she tries to scare her. At the same time, *REBECA* tries to test Calvin to find out more. They get into an argument. *CALVIN* gets in between them and something he says triggers something in *REBECA*, so she backs off and tells him that she will go shopping and leaves (the cupboard is still open)

After breakfast, [[marjorie]] again takes the dishes to the kitchen. She wonders why the supplies seem to be fully stocked.

In the trash she finds a make-up brush.

She additionally gathers adhesive tape from a drawer in the hall, and the fingerprint powder from the unlocked cupboard.

As she's back in her room after getting all the things, *BRIANNA* arrives and she is interrupted.

#### Noon

*BRIANNA* visits and [[marjorie]] questions her about *REBECA*.

#### Evening

In the meantime, *REBECA* is back. [[marjorie]] gets the fingerprints from the hook and tricks *REBECA* into drinking from a glass that [[marjorie]] snatches and gets her fingerprints off.

She compares the fingerprints, and they match. She's now convinced that *REBECA* is trying to scare her.

### Day 4

#### Early morning

[[marjorie]] wakes up to the sound of a fight. She walks down to find *CALVIN* shooting *REBECA*. *CALVIN* turns around and comes at her. In fear, she turns around and runs into her room and pushes a cupboard in front of her door.

*CALVIN* first tries to sweet-talk her, but ultimatively looses his nerves and screams at her. He shoots and pushes against the door. The cupboard moves and the door opens. *CALVIN* comes in, but is gunned down by the wounded *REBECA*, who breaks down.

### Day 5

#### Afternoon

[[marjorie]] sits with *BRIANNA*. They talk about *CALVIN*. In the end, [[marjorie]] confirms to *BRIANNA* that she will appear in court and make her testimony.

The end.

Fade in.

### DAY1 - HALL - MORNING

[[marjorie]], *CALVIN* and *REBECA* stand in the `HALL`, in front of the `front_door`. We see a bagpack, a bag and a `suitcase` in front of them. The bagpack belongs to *CALVIN*, the bag to *REBECA* and the `suitcase` to [[marjorie]].

They stand there for a few seconds, looking around. [[marjorie]] is frightened, she is taking in the uncommon surroundings. *REBECA* is annoyed, she is filling out a form.

*AMBIENT: Filling out a form*

*CALVIN* calmly looks around.

(beat) *AMBIENT: (stop)*

> *REBECA* (harsh)
>
> Living room is right this way, kitchen to the left, the bathroom and the bedrooms are upstairs. Your room is just across the stairs. Can't miss it.

*REBECA* takes her bag and walks off to the `LIVING_ROOM`.

*SFX: Walking on wooden floor*

(beat)

*CALVIN* looks at [[marjorie]], nods friendly. [[marjorie]] tries a smile. *CALVIN* takes his bagpack and walks off to the `LIVING_ROOM` as well.

*SFX: Walking on wooden floor*

[[marjorie]] grabs her `suitcase`.

### DAY1 - BEDROOM - MORNING

*MUSIC: Marjorie theme. Calming, relaxed*

[[marjorie]] enters the `BEDROOM`, looks around, then puts her `suitcase` on the `bedroom_bed`, opens it.

*SFX: Suitcase on bed, opening suitcase*

*Cutscene ends*

#### PUZZLE 1.1: Unpack

Click on the `suitcase`. Switch to `CLOSEUP_SUITCASE`

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Well. Time to unpack I guess.

Click (unpack) the items in the `suitcase`. Those items are presented in order:

- Shirts (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

- Sweaters (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

- Today's newspaper. Swiches to `CLOSEUP_NEWSPAPER` (*SFX: Unfolding paper*)

- Pants (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

When [[marjorie]] unpacks the pants, her `smartphone` falls out and smashes on the floor into four pieces: (*SFX: Object crashing on floor*)

- `smartphone_incomplete`

- `battery`

- `cover`

-

- `simcard`

They slide in all directions.

> [[marjorie]] (shouts)
>
> DAMN.

#### PUZZLE 1.2: Assembling the phone

Find the four items by examining the things in the `BEDROOM`:

- `bedroom_bed`
- `bedroom_wardrobe`
- `bedroom_nightstand`
- `bedroom_stool`

> [[marjorie]]
>
> I think that's all.

Combine the items with the `smartphone_incomplete`:

- `simcard` (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

- `battery` (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

- `cover` (*SFX: Inserting an object*)

> [[marjorie]]
>
> There. It works again.
>
> (beat)
>
> Ugh, it needs to be reset due to the clash. There's this tiny button on the side. I need something small. Like a paper clip or needle or something.

#### PUZZLE 1.3: Resetting the phone

Click the `suitcase` again and unpack further. Following items are unpacked:

- Toiletries bag (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

- Underwear (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

- Bras (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

- `purse` (*SFX: Taking clothes*)

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Ah, there's my purse. I had already packed it!

Open the `purse`. Switch to `CLOSEUP_PURSE`

Take the `hairpin` and use it to reset the `smartphone`.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> It's a bit too big for the hole, a paper clip would be better. (beat) But... (tries) yes, it works.
>
> Here we go.
>
> (beat)
>
> Ugh, now what was my PIN again? I always forget stuff like that.

#### PUZZLE 1.4: Finding the PIN

*SFX: Dialtones* (when buttons on phone are pressed)

Find the note in the `purse`.

Using 4872 as the pin yields:

> [[marjorie]]
>
> No, that's my credit card pin. I can remember that, because I use it more often.

Using RUBE(=7823) as the pin solves the puzzle

### DAY1 - BEDROOM - MORNING

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: The music gets dramatic and will culmulate when REBECA finds MARJORIE, then it underlines the shouting of REBECA and emotions of MARJORIE, ending with a dramatic MARJORIE theme line and a hard stop*

[[marjorie]] dials (*SFX: Dialtones*). After some moments, we hear:

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (very emotional) Mom? (beat) Hi, Mom. Yes, we arrived. (beat) Oh, it's okay, I guess. We're...

We hear *REBECA* from the outside:

> *REBECA*
>
> [[marjorie]], I have some shee...

*REBECA* has entered the door and sees her on the phone.

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) You idiot!

She rushes to [[marjorie]], grabs the `smartphone`, rips of the `simcard`, throws it out of the window and hides the `smartphone`. [[marjorie]] starts to cry.

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) What part of witness protection did you not understand, dumbass?

She walks up and down the room.

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) NOT only that I WASTE MY TIME AND FUCKING RISK MY LIFE babysitting her, she goes about and brings a FUCKING PHONE TO HER SAFE HOUSE.

She turns around, pointing at [[marjorie]]

> *REBECA*
>
> (getting really mean) Do you want him to kill you right away? We could all save some time in that case.

(beat, we hear [[marjorie]] sobbing)

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) Christ!

She exists the room, slamming the door. (*SFX: Door slam*, *MUSIC: Stops*)

*Fadeout*

### DAY1 - LIVING ROOM - NOON

[[marjorie]], *REBECA* and *CALVIN* are sitting on the `living_room_table`, eating takeaway chinese food. `day1_leftovers` and `day1_dishes` are on the `living_room_table`. The mood is tense.

*AMBIENT: People eating*

*MUSIC: CALVIN theme with a jazzy backtune*

> *CALVIN*

> *CALVIN*
>
> (looking at *REBECA*) REBECA?

> *REBECA*
>
> (grunts)
>
> (slurry) 'm sorry, I freaked 'cause you brought your fucking phone.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (sighs)
>
> What REBECA *tries* to say, is:
>
> We're here to protect you for the next five days, MARJORIE. That's our *job*.
>
> Key to that, is that nobody knows where you are. You understand?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (shy) ...Yes.

> *CALVIN*
>
> I know, this whole situation is scary and emotional for you, but you have to trust us. If you need to talk come to...

*CALVIN* points at him, then *REBECA*. (beat) *CALVIN* lowers his hand.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (Cont'd) Come to me. We're here for you if you need anything, okay?

*CALVIN* smiles at [[marjorie]].

[[marjorie]] shyly smiles back.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Thank you.

[[marjorie]] turns to *REBECA*.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> And I'm sorry. Bringing the phone really was a dumb idea. I just... I just miss my mom and yes, this is all very creepy for me.

> *REBECA*
>
> Yeah, whatever. Just try to not get killed, okay?
>
> (beat)
>
> (to herself) At least not on my watch.

They have finished eating.

[[marjorie]] rises.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> You know what? Let me handle this.

> Thank you, Marjorie.

*Cutscene ends*

[They talk.](dialogs/brianna1.md)

Fadeout

### DAY1 - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: None*

*CALVIN* and *REBECA* sit on opposite ends of the sofa with *CALVIN* sitting closer to the hall.

[[marjorie]] stands behind them.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (yawns) Allright, I'm off to bed. Have a good night.

> *CALVIN*
>
> You too.

> *REBECA*
>
> Bye.

[[marjorie]] exits the `LIVING_ROOM`, goes through the `HALL`, up the stairs, through the `UPPER_HALL` into the `BEDROOM` to find...

A noose dangling from the lamp.

*MUSIC: horror string slide merging into a rumbling and hectic MARJORIE tune*

[[marjorie]] screams, then runs out of the `BEDROOM`, through the `UPPER_HALL`, down the stairs. In the `HALL`, she bumps into *CALVIN*.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (concerned) What is it?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (freaked out, shouting) There's a noose in my room! Oh my god!

*CALVIN* runs past her up the stairs, draws his gun. *REBECA* arrives.

> *REBECA*
>
> (tense) A noose?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (shouting) Yes. By the lamp. Oh my *God*.

*REBECA* runs past her up the stairs. Seconds pass.

*MUSIC: Rumbling bass with shriek MARJORIE tunes, then: quiet.*

> *CALVIN* (from above)
>
> Marjorie?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Yes?

> *CALVIN*
>
> Can you come up please?

[[marjorie]] climbs the stairs, passes the `UPPER_HALL` to see *CALVIN* and *REBECA* in the `BEDROOM`, but no noose. *CALVIN* is panting, but calm. *REBECA* is looking at *CALVIN* with an irritated look.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> What the?

> *CALVIN* (interrupts, calm)
>
> Marjorie? Is everything alright?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (starts to cry, shouts) There was a noose! A fucking noose! I'm not crazy!

> *CALVIN*
>
> (goes to her, embraces her) It's okay, it's okay.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (into his jacket, distressed) I'm not crazy. It was there.

*REBECA* snaps out, then exits the room. *CALVIN* looks after her.

[[marjorie]] sobs.

*Fadeout*

### DAY 2 - MORNING - LIVING ROOM

*Cutscene ends*

*MUSIC: Calvin theme, calm*

*AMBIENT: Eating sounds*

[[marjorie]], *CALVIN* and *REBECA* are having breakfast at the table. There's toast, scrambled eggs, bacon and jam. The bacon is next to *REBECA*. *CALVIN* reads a "New York Standard" paper and randomly sips from a cup of coffee, *REBECA* is eating Muesli out of a bowl and staring out of the window. [[marjorie]] tries to make conversation.

A [dialog](dialogs/day2breakfast.md) unfolds.

*Cutscene starts*

After it, we fade out, and fade in again. *REBECA* now sits against the wall with the hatch, reading a file. *CALVIN* has put the paper on the desk and reads. [[marjorie]] stands. `day2_dishes` and the `day2_leftovers` are on the `living_room_table`.

*MUSIC: Marjorie-theme, calm*

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Let me put myself to use and clean this up.

> *CALVIN*
>
> Thank you, Marjorie.

*Cutscene ends*

The player can explore freely now.

(Optional) Take the `day2_dishes` and the `day2_leftovers` from the table. Go into the `KITCHEN`. Put the `day2_leftovers` into the `kitchen_trash_can`, clean the `day2_dishes` in the `kitchen_sink`.

The player has to complete the following puzzles:

#### PUZZLE 2.1: The Diary

Go up to `BEDROOM`, find the `gruesome_note`.

Solve the note puzzle to get the combination.

Open the `padlock` at the `bedroom_wardrobe_drawer_lower` using the combination. Find the `diary`. Read the `diary`.

Go to the `LIVING_ROOM`. *CALVIN* is gone. [Talk to *REBECA*](dialogs/rebeca2.md).

#### PUZZLE 2.2: Getting the phone back

Go into the `KITCHEN` and look through the `kitchen_hatch`. The scene is switched to `LIVING_ROOM` with [[marjorie]] looking through the `living_room_hatch`. Wait for the right moment to snatch the `smartphone` out of *REBECA*s `pocket`.

#### PUZZLE 2.3: Finding the wifi router

Turn on the `smartphone`. Switch to `CLOSEUP_SMARTPHONE`, it shows no mobile connection, but an accessible wifi. Connecting to it requires a password though.

The wifi signal display is set to 2 of 4 bars in the `KITCHEN` and the `LIVING ROOM`. It shows 3 of 4 bars in the `HALL` and the `BEDROOM`. It shows 4 of 4 bars in the `UPPER HALL`.

Looking at the `smartphone` and selecting the wifi signal in the  `UPPER HALL`  reveals a `upper_hall_loose_board`. It can be pried loose using a `knife` from the `KITCHEN`. Under the `upper_hall_loose_board` the `upper_hall_wifi_router` is revealed. Using it switches to `CLOSEUP_WIFI_ROUTER` When turning it around, a wifi password is revealed.

*SFX: mobile keyboard sounds while typing the following*

Entering the password as-is into the `smartphone` doesn't work though.

In the `kitchen_trash_can` you find the `password_note`, which, mentally combined with the password under the `upper_hall_wifi_router`,  reveals the actual wifi password. Enter it into the `smartphone` to connect to the wifi.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> There. Now, let's see what happened to Jacob Grimes. (pause)
>
> (to herself) Grimes, Grimes, Gri... Jacob Grimes. There you are. A New York Standard article from eighteen years ago.
>
> (reading) "Jacob Grimes, witness in the La Famiglia trial on the murder of Yared Mike Getahun, was found dead this Thursday afternoon while in (stops) witness protection of the New York Police."
>
> (puts down the `smartphone` briefly, then continues to read)
>
> "His body was found in his bedroom, where he apparently had hung himself. 'We can only assume, that the pressure and stress of the events affected him more than we realized. I deeply regret that we couldn't foresee this and help Jacob more', says (stops) Detective Calvin Andrews."

[[marjorie]]  puts down the `smartphone`. Blackout.

### DAY 2 - AFTERNOON - LIVING ROOM

*MUSIC: Brianna theme. Soft, calming*

[[marjorie]] sits on the sofa with *BRIANNA*. *BRIANNA*'s open suitcase lies on the couch table, *BRIANNA* opened a big folder on her lap. [[marjorie]] is nervous.

[They talk.](dialogs/brianna2.md)

### DAY 2 - NIGHT - BEDROOM

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: None*

*AMBIENT: None*

It's night. We see the `BEDROOM` only lit from the windows to the left. We see part of the bed with very hard shadows. [[marjorie]] lies in the bed. After a few seconds, Marjorie wakes up and rises in bed.

*SOUND: Creaking bed*

Suddenly, the bedroom is lit up, we see *IGINO* standing in the door, slowly rising a gun. [[marjorie]] opens her mouth as if to scream, but no scream is heard.

*MUSIC: Panic!*

### DAY 3 - EARLY MORNING - BEDROOM

We switch back to the dark `BEDROOM` and barely see the small explosion of the lightbulb, which makes a *SOUND: Plop*, which makes it blur to the gun scene.

*MUSIC: None*

[[marjorie]] startles up, screams. Then realizes, that she's safe. [[marjorie]] rises. She tries to turn on the `bedroom_lamp` using the `bedroom_light_switch` (*SFX: light switch*), which doesn't work.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Hm. I guess the bulb's dead.

*Cutscene ends*

*MUSIC: Eerie, very few notes. "Night atmosphere". Not too scary though.*

#### PUZZLE 3.1 - Fixing the lamp

Go into the `KITCHEN`, get the `stepladder` from the `kitchen_left_cupboard`. Use the `stepladder` with the `bedroom_lamp`. [[marjorie]] walks up the `stepladder` and unscrews the `broken_bulb`.

You can use the `broken_bulb` with all the lights in the house. Only the bulb from the `hall_lamp` matches. But it's too hot to touch. Find a `cloth` in the `KITCHEN` and use it to unscrew the `bulb`.

Screw the `bulb` into the `bedroom_lamp`

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: Get's more eerie and downright scary*

The light flashes on and [[marjorie]] gasps, startles, leans back and falls down the `stepladder` onto the floor.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> What the?

She rises again, climbs the `stepladder` again and looks up. The screen switches to `CLOSEUP_BEDROOM_LAMP`: We see, that the lamps hangs on a sturdy metallic hook.

*MUSIC: Horror strings*

> [[marjorie]]
>
> That's... that's the hook the noose was hanging from. Are you fucking kidding me?
>
> (pause)
>
> What's that on the hook?

*MUSIC: back to "Night atmosphere"*

*Cutscene ends*

#### PUZZLE 3.2 - Inspecting the hook

Get the `magnifying_glass` from the  `kitchen_right_drawer`.

Use the `magnifying_glass` with the `tiny_thing` on the hook.

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: Marjorie theme, will swell up during her monologue, then cut off when Marjorie shuts off the light*

> [[marjorie]]
>
> What. The. Fuck? That's hemp. So there *was* an actual noose hanging here?

[[marjorie]] climbs down the ladder and goes up and down the room.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> I can't believe it. That's... (back and forth)
>
> but... but why? (back and forth)
>
> Is it about my testimony? (back and forth)
>
> I can't fucking believe it. (stops in the middle of the room)
>
> Does she want to scare me? Is she involved in this? (goes to the light switch)
>

### DAY 3 - MORNING - LIVING ROOM

*MUSIC: Marjorie theme, jazzy background*

[[marjorie]] and *CALVIN* sit and eat breakfast. *REBECA* is at the now open `living_room_cupboard` making it `living_room_cupboard_unlocked`, fiddling around with its contents.

> *CALVIN*
>
> Rebeca? Are you coming?

No answer.

> *CALVIN*
>
> *Rebeca*?

> *REBECA* (grunts)
>
> *Fine*.

She comes over without locking the cupboard, drops down at the table and starts munching Muesli again.

A [dialog](dialogs/day3breakfast.md) unfolds.

> *CALVIN*
>
> Ladies, please!

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) I would if you would try to grow up, missy!

> *CALVIN*

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) Ladies! Can we please calm down again?

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) Tell that to her!

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) I'm telling that to each of you. Stop that! I don't want to lock you up in your room!

Quiet. *REBECA* stares at *CALVIN*. Seconds pass.

> *REBECA*
>
> (snaps out of it, looks around) We need groceries.

*REBECA* storms off. Seconds pass.

> *CALVIN*
>
> I'm... I'm sorry.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> No, please. I'm sorry. This was... I was...

> *CALVIN*
>
> It's okay, Marjorie. It's really hard, I know.

Seconds pass. *CALVIN* starts to clean the table.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Ah, you know what? Why don't you sit down, and I take care of the dishes again? As an apology.

> *CALVIN*
>
> You don't need to apologize, you know?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Thank you, but still... I just need something to do.

> *CALVIN*
>
> Okay then. Thank you.

He sits down again.

*Cutscene ends*

- Take the `day3_dishes` and clean them in the `KITCHEN`

#### PUZZLE 3.3: Getting the fingerprint kit

Take the `makeup_brush` from the `kitchen_trashcan`. Take the `tape` from a `hall_cupboard_drawer`. Get the `fingerprint_powder` from the `living_room_cupboard_unlocked`.

Go to the `BEDROOM`.

*Cutscene starts*

*SOUND: closing door*

> *BRIANNA*
>
> (shouting up) Marjorie? I'm here.

Marjorie takes a look at the lamp, sighs.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> *Coming!*

### DAY 3 - NOON - LIVING ROOM

*MUSIC: Brianna theme. Soft, calming*

[[marjorie]] sits on the sofa with *BRIANNA*. *BRIANNA*'s open suitcase lies on the couch table, *BRIANNA* opened a big folder on her lap. [[marjorie]] is nervous.

[They talk](dialogs/brianna3.md).

### DAY 3 - EVENING - LIVING ROOM

*REBECA* reenters the `LIVING_ROOM`, she seems confused.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (suspicious) Got everything you wanted? (referring to getting groceries)

*REBECA* subtly startles and looks at [[marjorie]]

> *REBECA*
>
> Huh?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> The groceries?

> *REBECA*
>
> (still confused) Gro... (realizes) oh yeah. Yeah.

*REBECA* exits the `LIVINGROOM` and enters the `KITCHEN`.

#### PUZZLE 3.4: Lifting fingerprints

Go to the `BEDROOM`. Combine the following items:

- `tape`
- `fingerprint_powder`
- `makeup_brush`

This will yield the `makeshift_fingerprint_kit`.

Use the `makeshift_fingerprint_kit` with the `bedroom_hook` to get `hook_fingerprints`.

#### PUZZLE 3.5: Getting fingerprints from Rebeca

Go to the `KITCHEN`. *REBECA* stands to the right, looking out the window.

[Talk to Rebeca](dialogs/rebeca3.md)

Use the `smartphone` to search for a recipe for a virgin mary.

Get the following items:

- `glass` from a cupboard in the `KITCHEN`
- `knife` from the drawer in the `KITCHEN`
- `lemon` from a bowl in the `LIVINGROOM`
- `tomatoes` and `jalapeno_peppers` from the fridge in the `KITCHEN`
- `hammer` from a drawer in the `HALL`
- `salt` and `pepper` from the table in the `LIVINGROOM`

Combine:

- `hammer` with `tomatoes` to get `mashed_tomatoes`
- `mashed_tomatoes` with `glass`
- `lemon` with `knife` to get `half_lemon`
- `half_lemon` with `glass`
- `salt` with `glass`
- `pepper` with `glass`
- `knife` with `jalapeno_peppers` to get `cut_peppers`
- `cut_peppers` with `glass`

After combining `mashed_tomatoes`, `half_lemon`, `salt`, `pepper`and `cut_peppers` are combined with `glass` the player gets the `makeshift_virgin_mary`.

Give `makeshift_virgin_mary` to *REBECA*.

> *REBECA*
>
> Huh? What? Is that...

> [[marjorie]]
>
> A makeshift Virgin Mary. As a peace offer.

> *REBECA*
>
> That's... That's genuinely nice. Thank you.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> You're welcome.

*REBECA* drinks.

> *REBECA*
>
> Not as good as in my favorite club, but still very good. Thanks, Marjorie.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Here, let me take that.

Takes the `used_glass` from *REBECA*.

#### PUZZLE 3.6: Comparing fingerprints

- Use the `makeshift_fingerprint_kit` with `used_glass` to get `rebeka_fingerprints`
- Use `rebeka_fingerprints` with `hook_fingerprints`

This puzzle consists of two panes (the two tapes with fingerprints). One of the panes is movable and has to be adjusted (rotated, panned) so that the two fingerprints match.

*Cutscene starts*

> [[marjorie]]
>
> They... they match.
>
> (pause)
>
> You. Bitch.

Fadeout.

### DAY 4 - EARLY MORNING - BEDROOM

*MUSIC: none*

We fadein to the night view of the `BEDROOM` and see [[marjorie]] sleeping.

After some seconds, we hear glass breaking downstairs and [[marjorie]] startles up.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (to herself) What the?

We hear muffled shouts from downstairs.

[[marjorie]] gets up.

*Cutscene ends*

Go down into the `LIVING_ROOM` to see light in the kitchen and the door opened. Here, we can clearly hear the shouting:

*MUSIC: Calvin theme, shrieking*

*Cutscene starts*

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) What the fuck, Calvin? You're a cop! Doesn't that mean anything to you?

[[marjorie]] ducks down and slowly approaches the kitchen.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) The fuck it means to me! Did you have a look at your paycheck recently, Officer Pliego?

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) And that would make you switch sides? Money? Come on, Calvin! That's so cliché!

[[marjorie]] reaches the kitchen and we switch to the `KITCHEN` with her looking in. *REBECA* has backed up to the right side of the screen. *CALVIN* is in the middle of the room.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) Of course it's money! It's always the money. A good conscience doesn't pay any bills!

> *REBECA*
>
> (shouting) Didn't you think somebody would find out eventually?

> *CALVIN*
>
> (suddenly calm, diabolic) Oh, I made sure nobody would find out. At least nobody alive...

*CALVIN* raises a gun at *REBECA*. [[marjorie]] screams. We quickly switch back to the `LIVING_ROOM`. A shot is heard.

*MUSIC: Calvin theme, hectic, chasing*

*SFX: Gunshot*

*Cutscene ends*

#### PUZZLE 4.1: Survive!

From this on we need to hurry. Staying in the `LIVING_ROOM`, the `HALL`, the `UPPER_HALL` or the (unboarded) `BEDROOM` more than 5 seconds will make *CALVIN* appear and shoot. If that happens, we're taken back to the beginning of this puzzle.

Go through the `HALL`, the `UPPER_HALL` into the `BEDROOM`. Close the `bedroom_door` and use the `bedroom_wardrobe` to push it in front of the door.

*Cutscene starts*

*MUSIC: Calvin theme, changing between shrieking and hectic*

[[marjorie]] goes to the left of her room. Then we hear *CALVIN* banging on the `bedroom_door`.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) Marjorie! Open up!

Seconds pass, *CALVIN* banging on the `bedroom_door`.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) Open up! This is the police! (laughs)
>
> (falling back to his "nice" voice) Listen, Marjorie! I'm really sorry, I really am! You just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time I'm afraid.

*CALVIN* banging on the `bedroom_door`.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) Let's face it, Mister Varone won't accept your blabbermouth in court!

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (shouting) I trusted you, Calvin!

*CALVIN* banging on the `bedroom_door`. The `bedroom_wardrobe` is shaking.

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) Yeah, like I said, I'm sorry!

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (shouting) You killed Rebeca!

> *CALVIN*
>
> (shouting) She was getting too close! She was getting suspicious...

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (shouting) She knew that you are a fucking bastard!

*CALVIN* banging on the `bedroom_door`. The `bedroom_wardrobe` is moving.

> *CALVIN*
>
> Well, a man's gotta provide for himself!

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (shouting) Did you kill Jacob too?

> *CALVIN*
>
> Ahh, the kid.

*CALVIN* banging on the `bedroom_door`. The `bedroom_wardrobe` moves some step away, the `bedroom_door` is visible.

> *CALVIN*
>
> He just didn't get the message, that little punk.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (shouting) Why did you have to kill them?

> *CALVIN*
>
> Because there was no other way!

*CALVIN* banging on the `bedroom_door`. The `bedroom_wardrobe` gives in, moves further away and the `bedroom_door` swings open. *CALVIN* comes in.

> *CALVIN*
>
> It's the same with you. Why didn't you just chicken out like they usually do?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (shouting) Usually?
>
> (quiet) Usually do? How many times have you pulled these tricks?

> *CALVIN*
>
> I've been in the force longer than you've been alive, missy.

*CALVIN* steps a bit closer

> *CALVIN*
>
> Igino Varone is a... busy man.

*CALVIN* raises his gun.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (cries out) NO!

> *CALVIN*
>
> You should have just been so petrified that you'd retract your testimony. But you're too stubborn for your own good.

*CALVIN* points his gun at [[marjorie]].

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (cries) nooo.

> *CALVIN*
>
> So this is on you, Marjorie, I'm afraid. And poor Rebeca killed you. Ah well, what a mess.
>
> Goodbye, Marjorie.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> NO!

The screen flashes white, a *SFX: Gunshot* is heard.

We see the `BEDROOM` again. *CALVIN* still stands in the middle of the room, with the raised gun. [[marjorie]] is on the left.

Suddenly *CALVIN* lowers his arm, we see blood on his shirt, he goes to his knees and then breaks down.

A wounded *REBECA* limps into the room, looks at *CALVIN*s body, then breaks down as well.

Blackout.

### DAY 5 - BLACK SCREEN

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (spoken as in the intro) So this is it?

(beat)

> *BRIANNA*
>
> This is it.

### DAY 5 - NOON - COURTHOUSE ROOM

We see the `COURTHOUSE_ROOM`. [[marjorie]] sits on one end of the table, *BRIANNA* beside her.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (exhales)

> *BRIANNA*
>
> You okay?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Yes, I guess.

> *BRIANNA*
>
> I'm so sorry about what happen...

> [[marjorie]]
>
> It's okay, Brianna.

> *BRIANNA*
>
> I just don't understand how Calvin could do that all those times. This is a disaster.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> No doubt.

> *BRIANNA*
>
> And we have to revisit all the old cases. Each and every one where the witness bailed out in the last second. And that's a lot.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> All because of that fuck.

Silence.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Oh, how's Rebeca?

> *BRIANNA*
>
> She is... recovering. She sends her regards.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (surprised) She did?

> *BRIANNA*
>
> Yeah. Specifically, she said "Kick this fucker's ass!"

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (laughs) Yeah, that sounds more like her.

They laugh.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> She saved my life.

> *BRIANNA*
>
> I guess so. She said, on that evening with the noose, Calvin came rushing out of your bedroom with something tacked in his suit, but when he came back it was gone.
>
> And then Calvin said something about locking you up.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (nodding) When we were fighting. I remember.

> *BRIANNA*
>
> Yes, and it came to Rebecas mind, that Jacob was locked up as well and then she really got suspicious and started to investigate.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> (to herself) The groceries!

> *BRIANNA*
>
> What?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Rebeca said she was about to get groceries but the cupboards were full. She was investigating then.

> *BRIANNA*
>
> Yeah and the next morning they got into a... fight. But you know the details.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Yes. (pause)
>
> I need to apologize to Rebeca when she's out of the hospital. I suspected that the one trying to scare me was her. I even found her fingerprints on the hook in my room.

> *BRIANNA*
>
> I guess she did some investigating of her own there.

> [[marjorie]]
>
> I guess so.

Pause.

> *BRIANNA*
>
> You're ready?

> [[marjorie]]
>
> Yeah.
>
> Let's... (smiling) Let's kick ass.

They rise.

Fadeout.

*MUSIC: Credits music. A happy and triumphant Marjorie theme*

The end. Roll the credits.

##### `CLOSEUP_DIARY`

The diary is just an old ring-bound notepad with ballpen scriblings on it. They are readable of course, but show the rising pressure and tension of the writer. It's fake though. It wasn't *actually* written by Jacob Grimes, it's something Calvin uses to scare Marjorie. Each day starts a new page.

On the first page it reads: "JAYGEE's diary"

###### Tuesday

The attorney said I should write this. It may help me to concentrate. I never wrote a diary and it feels weird. Anyways, here goes.

It's okay here. The house is nice. But I don't want to be here. Why the hell did I need to tag that wall on Cooper Avenue? Couldn't I just stay home? Just for one fucking night?

Bah. It's soooooo boring. There's nothing to do.

The cops are alright though. They are nice.

###### Wednesday

If I wouldn't be out there I wouldn't have seen that Italian killing Derek. I guess, Derek was fucking with La Famiglia's business in the Bronx. That idiot.

And then I even went to the cops. ME! What was I thinking? And now, La Famiglia is on my ass. I can feel it. They don't want me speaking up.

I hope I'm safe here. The house is not nice. It's creepy. It's fucking with my head.

###### Thursdy

Fuck!  I'm not safe here. The cops are no help. The Famiglia bastards are on their way. I can feel it.

They want my head. They don't accept if somebody speaks up. They're far too powerful. They're everywhere.

Fuck! FUCK!

###### Frid

They're downstairs, damnit! I can hear them. They're calling me. THEY WANT MY HEAD.

But I won't let them. No, sir. I'm gonna lock my room.

##### `CLOSEUP_NEWSPAPER`

A typical New York newspaper called "New York Standard". There's a big article with a photo of *IGINO*, and several articles around it.

The articles read:

**MOB BOSS ON TRIAL** by Tyrice Curtis

*IGINO* Varone (shown left), the alleged head of "La Famiglia", the New York based crime organization, will be on trial this friday afternoon after having been accused of killing a shop owner in the lower east side.

District Attorney *BRIANNA* Allison tells the New York Standard that she will aim for a life sentence. "We have solid evidence", Misses Allison says, "We also have a witness, so I have no doubt that the jury will rule in our favor. It's time that we put an end to the business of La Famiglia!"

The trial will start on Friday, 4pm, court room 10.

**HOMELESS SHELTER GOES UP IN FLAMES** by Jasmine Guyot

East village - a building used as a homeless shelter burnt down to the ground yesterday evening. Officer Mike Greyson, who was the first at the crime scene, told the New York Standard that arson can not be ruled out at this point. Until the police has other leads, the remains of the shelter will be treated as a crime scene. It's recommended to stay clear of the area due to the probable instability of the building. The gruesome numbers are as of yet: 12 casualties, 34 people with burn injuries, that have been taken to Beth Israel Hospital.

**VISIT SWEDEN! A TRAVEL COMMENTARY** by Carol Reed

New York Standard's own Carol Reed is travelling Europe and reports all about the nicest destinations in the old world.

This time, Carol visits the town of Norrköping, just about 120 miles east of Stockholm, Sweden's capital. Read all about Sweden's wonderful countryside and art on page 14.

**POLICE NOTICES**

New York City police are investigating after a dumpster was found Monday night filled with dozens of pounds of cocaine. Police says the 60 pounds of cocaine was estimated to be worth $6.6 million.
A person, suspected of a crime related to the incident, is held in police custody awaiting a court hearing.

##### `CLOSEUP_GRUESOME_NOTE`

The gruesome note is a worn-out paper with what appears to be an eerie child poem that goes like this:

The itsy, bitsy spider
went up the pyramid
down came the sphere
and rolled right over it.

Then fell the cube and
crushed it right and then,
the really ugly spider
could never climb again.

### Music

The idea for the music is, that the characters Marjorie, Calvin and Brianna have themes. Each of these themes have different variations and reprises that are used throughout the game to gently hint which character is currently in focus of the game.

The themes should reflect the character's personality or functions in the game:

- Marjorie: caring, emotional. As Marjorie is the main character of the game, it should be the most "catchy" theme
- Calvin: Calvin is a two-sided character. On the surface, he's caring and helpful, but under the surface lies a deeply immoral and greedy persona
- Brianna: Brianna's character represents the law and gives structure to the game

Here's a list of all music references in the game (search for MUSIC:)
