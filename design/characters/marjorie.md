Marjorie Tailor, the main character

*MARJORIE* is a black woman, aged 34. At the beginning of the game, she is calm and shy and insecure. Through the events in the game, she becomes confident and strong.

Because *REBECA* is very rough to her, she begins to suspect, that she tries to scare her, but ultimatively, it's *CALVIN* that tries to attack her, and this gets settled in the very last scene.

Throughout the game, she is scared (her fears growing with the events)
