# CALVIN

Calvin Andrews, a police officer

*CALVIN* is one of the two detectives that ought to protect *MARJORIE* in the safe house. However, he's actually also on Varone's payroll and staged the suicide of *JACOB* Grimes eighteen years ago. He tries to scare and eventually kill *MARJORIE* (which is only revealed on the last day)

Superficially, he's a nice and caring man in his 50s. Father-figure type. This is the (visual) progression that he goes through: Starting as nice and trustworthy and becoming mean and ruthless.
